Here are the top 10 key takeaways from Senada Greca's transformative journey from struggling with body dysmorphia to becoming Kim Kardashian's trainer and a leading advocate for women's strength training.

## 1. From body dysmorphia to self-acceptance

Senada struggled with body dysmorphia and anorexia during her teens and early twenties. Even at her thinnest, she couldn't see herself accurately, always viewing herself as "fat" or "big." This severe distortion of self-image led to extreme caloric restriction—only a few hundred calories per day—which caused significant health problems including loss of her menstrual cycle.

The turning point came when she met a physician in her early twenties who was running marathons in her 50s. This doctor inspired Senada to shift her mindset toward exercise for mental health rather than just for appearance. She gradually learned to nourish her body properly to fuel her workouts instead of restricting calories. This transition marked the beginning of her journey toward self-acceptance and a healthier relationship with food and exercise.

## 2. Strength training transformed her self-perception

Senada's biggest transformation came when she shifted from cardio-focused training to strength training in her early 30s. This change fundamentally altered how she viewed herself and her body. Rather than striving to be "thin enough," she began wanting to look "as strong as possible."

Strength training gave Senada a consistency in her physical appearance that cardio never did. More importantly, it boosted her confidence and self-esteem dramatically. She describes feeling strong, confident, and almost "invincible" after strength training sessions—feelings she never experienced with cardio alone. This mental shift from focusing on thinness to embracing strength allowed her to step into her true power and develop a healthier body image.

Strength training helped her occupy space unapologetically and appreciate her body's capabilities rather than just its appearance. This mindset shift revolutionized her relationship with her body and herself.

## 3. The profound mental health benefits of exercise

Exercise has been Senada's most effective tool for managing depression and anxiety, conditions she has a genetic predisposition to. While she tried medication, it never provided the lasting relief that exercise did. She describes working out as a reliable way to shift her mood and perspective, even on days when she doesn't feel like exercising.

When feeling depressed or anxious, Senada knows a workout will transform her day. This reliable mental health benefit motivates her even when her initial motivation is low. She views exercise as a natural, sustainable approach to mental wellness that comes with no negative side effects—only benefits.

Exercise became her self-therapy, complemented by extensive reading of self-help books and occasional plant medicine experiences. These practices helped her become her own therapist, enabling her to recognize patterns and gain perspective on her challenges.

## 4. Consistency trumps perfection

Senada emphasizes that consistency is far more important than perfection when establishing fitness habits. She notes that most people quit workout programs within the first three to six months, and 88% of New Year's resolutions fail within the first two weeks. The main reason? Unrealistic expectations and focusing on results rather than the process.

For beginners, Senada recommends making consistency the primary goal—simply showing up day after day. It takes about 66 days to solidify a habit, much longer than the commonly cited 21 days. By making the process the goal rather than specific results, people set themselves up for long-term success.

Progress takes time, whether building muscle or losing weight. It typically requires three to six months to see meaningful results from a fitness program. Understanding this timeline helps manage expectations and maintain motivation through the challenging early stages.

## 5. Building muscle is crucial for longevity

One of Senada's most passionate messages is about the importance of building and maintaining muscle mass for longevity. She cites research showing that people begin losing 3-8% of muscle mass per decade starting in their 30s. This natural decline makes it essential to build as much muscle as possible earlier in life.

Muscle loss significantly impacts quality of life as we age. Senada references the "I've fallen and can't get up" commercials showing elderly people unable to push themselves off the ground—a direct consequence of muscle loss. Building strength early creates a reserve that helps maintain independence in later years.

The capacity to build muscle diminishes with age. In our 40s, we can gain approximately 2-8 pounds of muscle per year with consistent training, dropping to 1.2-6 pounds in our 50s. Muscle loss begins within about two weeks of inactivity, making consistent strength training throughout life essential for maintaining mobility and independence.

## 6. The psychology of body image and cultural trends

Body image issues often stem from multiple factors: critical parents, societal pressures, and media portrayals of unrealistic beauty standards. For Senada, having a hyper-critical mother who insisted on nothing less than being the best created tremendous pressure. While this drove her success, it also contributed to her body image issues.

Senada observed that people with eating disorders often seek control through their bodies when other aspects of life feel uncontrollable. This was true for her as a teenager navigating life in a new country while serving as the family translator. Food restriction became a way to exert control amid overwhelming circumstances.

Body ideals have shifted over time—from extreme thinness in the 80s and 90s to curves and now increasingly toward strength and muscle. Senada hopes the current emphasis on strength represents a lasting shift, supported by research showing the health benefits of muscle for women specifically.

## 7. The danger of extreme weight loss methods

Senada strongly cautions against drastic weight loss, whether through severe calorie restriction or medications like Ozempic. Rapid weight loss triggers the body's survival mechanisms—hormonal disruption, hair loss, and loss of menstrual cycle as the body shuts down "unnecessary" functions to conserve energy.

When weight loss happens too quickly, people lose not just fat but significant muscle mass. This undermines long-term health and makes maintaining weight loss more difficult. Senada believes in starting with natural approaches—proper nutrition, exercise, sleep, and meditation—before considering pharmaceutical interventions.

For those who do need medications like Ozempic, Senada notes that microdosing approaches that allow for gradual weight loss help preserve muscle mass. However, she emphasizes that the foundation should always be healthy lifestyle habits, with medications as a supplementary tool when necessary.

## 8. Finding purpose through service to others

Senada's struggle with depression ultimately led her to find purpose in serving others. Despite achieving academic success (graduating summa cum laude and earning a business degree), she felt unfulfilled until she began helping others experience the same physical and mental transformation she had undergone.

Her greatest concern now is whether she's providing enough value to her audience. This drive to serve led her to launch the We Rise app, which she's developing into more than just a fitness platform but a comprehensive female empowerment and development resource. The app offers programs for all experience levels, meal planning, macro tracking, and expert guidance on nutrition and habit formation.

Senada believes a purposeful life comes through being of service to others. She feels fulfilled knowing that even helping one person change their path represents a meaningful accomplishment. This service-oriented approach has given her life meaning beyond personal achievements.

## 9. The immigrant experience shaped her resilience

Moving to the United States from Albania as a teenager profoundly shaped Senada's life. At 15, she became the only English speaker in her family, forcing her to take on adult responsibilities—translating at doctor appointments, filling out paperwork, and essentially becoming a parent while trying to fit into a new culture as a teenager.

This pressure contributed to her depression, anxiety, and eating disorder as she sought control in an overwhelming situation. However, it also built tremendous resilience. She watched her father transition from being a doctor in Albania to working as a janitor in America, never complaining as he put his ego aside to support his family.

These early challenges taught Senada to persevere through difficulties and recognize the strength that comes from overcoming obstacles. The immigrant experience gave her a unique perspective on resilience and the importance of adapting to change—qualities that later helped her build her fitness career.

## 10. Approaching fitness from a place of love

Senada's training philosophy emphasizes approaching fitness from a place of love rather than criticism or punishment. She encourages women to focus on becoming the strongest version of themselves rather than comparing to others or trying to achieve someone else's body type.

She recognizes that genetic diversity means not everyone can or should look the same. Her goal is to empower women to embrace their natural musculature and strength, focusing on health and longevity rather than just aesthetics. Though she acknowledges the aesthetics will come naturally with consistent training.

When working with Kim Kardashian, Senada saw an opportunity to influence millions of women by showcasing strength as beautiful and healthy. By helping a major celebrity embrace strength training and muscle building, she's contributing to shifting cultural perceptions about women's bodies and fitness. Senada's ultimate message is that strength is not just about physical appearance but about quality of life and independence as we age.
