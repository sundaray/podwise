Here are the top 10 key takeaways from Dean Graziosi's conversation with Lewis Howes about thriving financially during uncertain economic times.

## 1. Develop hunger regardless of economic conditions

Finding a deeper level of hunger is essential during uncertain economic times. Dean explains that most Fortune 500 companies were started during recessions because while most people retreat due to fear, those with hunger gain a competitive advantage. This hunger must come from within and not be affected by external circumstances.

The key difference between successful people and others is their depth of hunger that external conditions don't diminish. Though successful people may still experience doubts and fears internally, when it's time to perform, they play with hunger as if someone might take everything away from them.

## 2. Money is like oxygen

Dean compares money to oxygen - when it's abundant, you don't think about it and can focus on more important things. When money is scarce, it dominates your thoughts like oxygen would if you couldn't breathe. This scarcity mindset prevents people from living into their full potential.

When you don't have enough money, it occupies your mind and affects countless decisions. People with financial struggles often can't focus on personal growth or relationships because they're constantly thinking about survival. Getting money "out of the way" allows you to breathe and focus on becoming a better version of yourself.

## 3. Create a compelling future

Having a compelling future is crucial for motivation and perseverance. Dean believes you can't live a happy today without a compelling tomorrow. A compelling future acts like a rope pulling you forward, giving you the courage and resourcefulness to overcome current challenges.

Those who find success despite difficult circumstances have established a future vision so compelling that they're willing to accept temporary hardship. This mindset shift helps people realize that living through difficult times now can lead to a better future. Rather than focusing on today's struggles, focus on the person you're becoming.

## 4. Model proven practices

Instead of trying to figure everything out yourself, find someone who has already achieved what you want and model their proven practices. Most people think their vision and dreams are unique, but someone has likely already figured out the path to similar success.

Modeling proven practices means obsessively searching for mentors who've done what you want to do. This could involve reading their books multiple times, listening to their podcasts, or even working for them for free. By studying their methods, you get shortcuts to success because they've already discovered and solved common problems.

## 5. Pain can be fuel but isn't required for success

Dean once believed the pain from his difficult childhood was necessary for his success, thinking that healing would make him lose his edge. However, he discovered that after healing his past trauma, he became even hungrier for success, but from a healthier place.

If you need motivation, you can briefly tap into painful memories like "nitrous oxide" to boost your drive, but don't dwell there. Use past pain strategically while focusing primarily on a compelling future. You can be equally driven by the positive vision of who you want to become rather than just trying to escape who you were.

## 6. Focus on progress, not perfection or comparison

Creating a "culture of progress" rather than perfection or comparison is essential for sustained success and happiness. Comparing yourself to others or to an idealized version of yourself can only lead to depression. Instead, measure whether you're a better version of yourself today than you were last week, month, or year.

Everyone progresses at different rates, but consistent forward movement is what matters. Tracking your progress creates positive momentum and helps maintain perspective during challenging times. This mindset shift allows you to acknowledge how far you've come rather than focusing on how far you still have to go.

## 7. Live hard now to live differently later

Dean emphasizes the importance of making sacrifices today for a better tomorrow. He explains that it's hard to work diligently, develop skills, model practices, face failure, and keep going - but the payoff is worth it. Those who put in the work now can live unlike everyone else later.

The temporary difficulty of disciplined living yields lasting rewards. Just as physical exercise is challenging but provides long-term health benefits, financial discipline brings future freedom. Working hard now provides the opportunity to control your schedule, time, and life choices in ways that most people never experience.

## 8. The four-step pyramid framework

Dean shares a pyramid framework for achievement with four components. At the top is a single, stretched goal that seems impossible and forces innovative thinking. Below that are the constraints or problems preventing achievement, which should be identified and addressed one at a time.

The third component is measuring progress, as no one would play a game without keeping score. The fourth and final piece is setting a firm deadline, as most people don't miss deadlines but will procrastinate indefinitely without one. This framework provides clear direction and accountability for achieving significant goals.

## 9. Be effective, not just efficient

While working with Tony Robbins, Dean learned the difference between being efficient and effective. During COVID, he was efficiently implementing changes but failing to consider the human element. Tony pointed out that effectiveness requires building relationships and bringing people along in the process.

True effectiveness comes from including others in planning and implementation. Instead of presenting a fully formed plan, it's better to invite collaboration and co-authorship. This approach honors the human condition and creates buy-in from everyone involved, making the execution more successful and sustainable.

## 10. These are the good old days

Dean advises appreciating the present moment rather than waiting for future success to be happy. He references Nike founder Phil Knight, who realized that the early struggling days of building Nike were when he felt most alive. Many people only recognize their "good old days" in retrospect.

The challenges, problem-solving, and growth happening right now are part of what makes life meaningful. While striving for future success is important, equally important is recognizing that today's struggles are creating memories and experiences to be cherished. Finding gratitude for the present moment enhances quality of life regardless of circumstances.
