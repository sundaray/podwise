Here are the top 10 key takeaways from David Ghiyam's insights on relationships that will transform how you view love, pain, and personal growth.

## 1. Overgiving can destroy relationships

Giving too much too soon in a relationship can actually harm it. David shares an example of a man who gave expensive gifts and a credit card to a woman within three weeks of dating. When you flood someone with excessive giving before they've earned it or built capacity to receive it, they often end up losing respect for you.

This creates what David calls "bread of shame" - a feeling that comes when you receive something you haven't physically or spiritually earned. Despite what many might think, this pattern typically ends with the recipient leaving the relationship because something essential is missing on a soul level.

## 2. Our souls choose specific challenges for growth

According to Kabbalah wisdom shared by David, our souls deliberately choose the challenges we face in life. What appears as coincidence or bad luck is actually part of our soul's pre-planned journey to transform specific issues we need to overcome.

Our souls select situations and relationships that will trigger our deepest wounds so we can heal them. For example, if you have abandonment issues, your soul didn't develop these because your parents divorced; rather, your soul chose parents who would divorce to help bring out this pre-existing issue that needed healing.

This perspective shifts us from being victims of circumstances to understanding that difficult experiences are opportunities for spiritual growth.

## 3. The bread of shame concept

The "bread of shame" is a spiritual concept describing what happens when we receive something we haven't earned either physically or spiritually. This creates feelings of frustration, impatience, and judgment rather than gratitude.

People who are most judgmental and critical are often those who are receiving much in life without having worked for it spiritually. Their negativity stems not from getting too little but from getting too much without having developed the spiritual vessel to properly receive it.

This explains why people who work hardest and push through challenges tend to be more appreciative and less judgmental. They've earned what they receive.

## 4. Focus on building your vessel, not seeking more light

David emphasizes that most people are too focused on getting more (more love, more success, more attention) instead of building their capacity to receive. He calls this "building your vessel" - developing yourself spiritually to be able to hold and appreciate what you receive.

We should view every relationship as an opportunity to build our vessel rather than just seeking to extract benefits. Even challenging relationships with difficult people serve a purpose in helping us develop our capacity.

This shift in focus - from constantly seeking more to developing our ability to properly receive - is fundamental to spiritual growth and finding fulfillment.

## 5. The purpose of toxic relationships

What we perceive as toxic relationships are actually spiritual opportunities. According to David, these difficult relationships are pre-programmed encounters designed to activate our weakest parts so we can heal them.

When we blame others for being toxic or narcissistic, we remain stuck in the same pattern. If we block or avoid one difficult person, we'll simply attract another with similar traits until we learn the lesson our soul is trying to master.

Instead of focusing on escaping these relationships, we should ask what our soul requested this person to teach us. Often narcissists are attracted to parts of ourselves that don't feel deserving of love.

## 6. Free will exists only in moments of pain

David explains that on the day we're born, our entire life's destiny is pre-programmed. However, parallel to this destiny are infinite alternative destinies that represent better or worse versions of our life path.

Free will only truly exists in moments of darkness and pain. When we're suffering, we have the opportunity to transform our nature and shift to a higher destiny. These moments of challenge reveal our weaknesses and give us the chance to correct them.

If we respond to pain by transforming ourselves rather than blaming others, we elevate to a better pre-programmed destiny. This is why difficult periods are essential for spiritual growth.

## 7. The certainty principle in relationships

One of the most powerful spiritual practices is maintaining certainty that everything happening is good and purposeful. David recommends responding to all difficulties - from broken phones to broken hearts - with the affirmation "this is good."

This doesn't mean doing nothing in response to challenges. Rather, it means accepting what is happening before taking action. The degree of our happiness in acceptance determines how quickly we vibrate on the level of godliness.

When we accept difficulties with certainty, we reveal the light of the creator and darkness naturally dissipates. Without this acceptance, we enter pathways with additional challenges designed to eventually bring us back to certainty.

## 8. True giving versus taking in disguise

Many people believe they're giving when they're actually taking. If you do something for someone but have an agenda or expect something in return (even just validation), you're energetically taking rather than giving.

David shares his personal realization that he needed to develop the ability to receive after years of only focusing on giving to others. The word "Kabbalah" itself means "to receive," highlighting the importance of creating a vessel for receiving as well as giving.

Even when receiving compliments, true giving means accepting them graciously rather than deflecting, which actually hurts the giver.

## 9. The problem with labeling past relationships as toxic

When we label ex-partners or past relationships as "toxic" and share that belief with others, we guarantee we'll repeat the pattern. David explains this as essentially saying the creator is toxic, since nothing happens without divine supervision.

This perspective disconnects us from creation and plunges us into a cycle of having to face more challenges until we learn the lesson. Instead, we should bless former partners and recognize the purpose they served in our growth.

Every word spoken about a past relationship being toxic or a waste of time delays meeting your soulmate. Choosing to bless rather than curse those who hurt us accelerates our path to finding true love.

## 10. Soulmates aren't about finding "the one"

The common focus on finding "the one" perfect soulmate misses the deeper spiritual truth. David suggests shifting focus from finding "the one" to becoming "the one" yourself - transforming into a vessel for divine light.

There are many forms of soulmates and many aspects of our souls that must match with other souls. Some soulmates may be with us for a lifetime, while others appear for shorter periods to help us grow.

David's own experience with his ex-wife, from whom he's separated but maintains a loving friendship, business partnership, and co-parenting relationship, demonstrates how soulmate connections can transform rather than end. The purpose of relationships is to help us become the best version of ourselves, not necessarily to last forever in their original form.
