Here are the top 10 key takeaways from Big Sean's conversation with Lewis Howes that reveal his mindset on success, abundance, and personal growth.

## 1. Trust your feelings over appearances

Big Sean emphasizes the importance of trusting what you feel rather than just what you see. When nothing was happening with his career for four years after getting signed, he maintained faith by trusting his inner feelings. He believes that while we can't always trust what we see, our feelings provide reliable guidance.

This perspective helped him navigate uncertain periods in his career. Sean describes visualizing standing on a cliff with an invisible bridge ahead—one that required faith to cross. He didn't focus on "how" success would happen, just that it would happen at the right time if he prepared himself properly.

## 2. Separate circumstances from happiness

One of Sean's most profound realizations was learning that external circumstances don't determine happiness. During a particularly dark period in 2017, despite having fame, wealth, and career success, he was deeply unhappy. This taught him that different aspects of life aren't tied together.

He discovered that allowing external circumstances to dictate emotional states creates unnecessary suffering. Sean emphasizes that while disappointments will occur, we shouldn't let them linger or define our emotional state. Learning to separate professional setbacks from personal happiness became crucial to his wellbeing and continued success.

## 3. Scarcity is an illusion

Sean describes breaking the "cycle of scarcity" in his family by recognizing it as an illusion. He challenges the common belief that money is hard to earn or that certain activities can't be profitable. This mindset shift allowed him to see abundance where others saw limitation.

He made an agreement with himself that as long as he operates from his heart and remains of service, he'll always have what he needs. This perspective replaced the fear-based approach to resources he had previously adopted. The belief in abundance rather than scarcity became foundational to his approach to life and opportunities.

## 4. Setting boundaries creates necessary space

Learning to set boundaries became one of Sean's most important life lessons. He notes that establishing boundaries often creates friction, especially with people you've known for a long time. People may react negatively when you begin setting limits they're not accustomed to.

The hardest boundary for Sean was learning to say no to avoid being overwhelmed. Despite potential negative reactions, he discovered that those meant to be in his life will respect his boundaries. He emphasizes that setting boundaries is an act of self-care that enables better service to others and yourself.

## 5. Manifestation requires frequency alignment

Sean explains manifestation as putting yourself on the frequency of whatever you desire. He avoids saying "I want" something because it acknowledges lack. Instead, he uses phrases like "I desire" or "I can't wait until" to align his energy with already having what he seeks.

This approach puts him in an abundance mindset rather than a scarcity one. Sean describes how action combines with allowing—you put attention on your intention, take proactive steps, but then must also trust and let go. This balance creates the conditions for manifestation to occur naturally.

## 6. Your subconscious mind can't distinguish reality from imagination

The subconscious mind accepts whatever you tell it, making it crucial to monitor self-talk. Sean describes the subconscious as "your best gullible friend in the world" that believes whatever you say. Negative self-talk is registered as truth by your subconscious.

This understanding guides how Sean approaches affirmations and self-talk. He practices daily affirmations focusing on gratitude. By consciously feeding his mind positive messages, he reprograms his subconscious to support his goals rather than undermine them with limiting beliefs.

## 7. Success doesn't guarantee happiness

Despite achieving fame and selling millions of records, Sean experienced his deepest depression in 2017 when "everything was happening" for him. This paradox taught him that traditional markers of success don't automatically create fulfillment or joy. He was confused by his unhappiness despite having "everything he ever wanted."

During this time, Sean was using substances, neglecting self-care, and pushing himself constantly. He realized he had abandoned his passions and free time in pursuit of success. This period taught him that balance and self-care are essential components of genuine success, not optional extras.

## 8. Time is the most valuable investment

Sean identifies time as the most precious resource we have. Unlike money, time cannot be replaced once spent. He believes investing time in what matters yields greater returns than any financial investment could provide.

This perspective shapes his priorities, particularly as a parent. When wondering if spending time with his one-year-old son was worthwhile since the child wouldn't remember it, his father reminded him that "his DNA will remember." Sean now values time investment in relationships and meaningful activities as the foundation of a fulfilling life.

## 9. Healing requires honest communication

Therapy provided Sean with a space for communication about issues he wouldn't normally discuss with friends or family. He describes communication as "the bridge to salvation" where each step matters. Therapy helped him unpack limiting beliefs and heal emotional wounds.

Through therapy, Sean learned to identify and release concepts that weren't serving him. He shares a powerful practice of saying "delete, destroy, uncreate and transmute across all time, space, dimension and realities" when confronting limiting beliefs. This process helped him overcome the pervasive feeling that he wasn't deserving of success.

## 10. Greatness means living at your highest frequency

Sean defines greatness as "living at the highest frequency in every aspect" and "getting the most out of life." Rather than external achievements, greatness emerges from how fully you engage with life and express your authentic self. It's about quality of experience rather than quantity of accomplishments.

He emphasizes that this definition is personal and varies for each individual. Greatness isn't measured by comparison to others but by how completely you fulfill your own potential. It requires self-knowledge, courage to follow your own path, and commitment to living with purpose and passion.
