Here are the top 10 key takeaways from Robert Herjavec's interview with Lewis Howes, where he shares his journey from immigrant poverty to entrepreneurial success and the mindset shifts that made it possible.

## 1. Poverty mindset versus situation

Robert explains that as a child immigrant, he didn't identify personally with poverty despite living in poor conditions. He viewed poverty as his situation, not his identity. This crucial distinction helped him avoid internalizing limiting beliefs about himself.

Coming to Canada at age eight, he first learned about "being poor" from other children at school who labeled him as a "poor immigrant." Until then, he had simply seen his village lifestyle as normal since everyone around him lived similarly. This perspective protected him from developing a poverty mindset early in life.

## 2. Hard work versus smart work

Hard work is foundational but insufficient for creating wealth. Robert's father worked incredibly hard in factories with two shifts, yet never achieved great wealth. Hard work prevents poverty, but doesn't guarantee riches.

The breakthrough came when Robert realized he needed to pivot from merely working hard to working smart. He understood he couldn't physically work any harder than he already was. The path to greater success required creating more value, not just putting in more hours. This realization fundamentally changed his approach to business and wealth creation.

## 3. The importance of an emotional connection with customers

Robert discovered that creating emotional connections with customers was crucial, even in highly technical industries like cybersecurity. People remember how you make them feel, not just what you sell them. When AT&T evaluated his company, they found issues with their systems but 97% of customers would buy from them again.

This approach differentiated his business in the tech world. Instead of just focusing on technical features, his team prioritized how they made customers feel during sales calls. They sold comfort and safety rather than just cybersecurity software, emphasizing outcomes and feelings rather than features.

## 4. Curiosity and continuous learning

Robert demonstrated an exceptional willingness to learn without expectation of immediate reward. When working at a high-end clothing store, he was the only employee who showed up on Saturdays for unpaid learning sessions with the owner. His colleagues said, "No one's paying me to show up," but Robert recognized the immense value in learning from successful people.

This curiosity allowed him to seek out and learn from successful mentors like Harry Rosen and Warren Avis, founders of billion-dollar companies. His eagerness to improve led him to valuable opportunities others missed. Robert believes this curiosity is a common trait among billionaires he's met.

## 5. The role of purpose in success

Purpose drives sustainable success far beyond material goals. Robert learned this lesson when speaking with military leaders who explained why successful military personnel often struggle in business. Despite their discipline and work ethic, they often lack the clear purpose that motivated their military service.

When Robert faced his darkest period, reconnecting with purpose through service at a homeless mission helped restore his sense of value. He realized that without purpose, no amount of wealth brings fulfillment. This understanding transformed his definition of "making it" from acquiring possessions to maximizing his potential and feeling he couldn't have done more with his life.

## 6. The value of brutal self-honesty

Being brutally honest with yourself is critical for growth. When a customer told Robert he "dressed like crap," he didn't get offended but instead accepted the critique and sought improvement, leading him to work at a high-end clothing store to learn better style.

Robert believes many people fail because they lie to themselves. Recently, he caught himself in the lie of thinking he had "made it" and was too old (at 62) to start something new. Recognizing this falsehood allowed him to see he still had immense potential and capital to create more. This willingness to confront uncomfortable truths about himself has been a consistent driver of his growth.

## 7. The three traits of billionaires

After working with many billionaires, Robert identified three common traits. First, they exhibit obsessive focus on specific domains rather than general knowledge. Second, they maintain intense curiosity that drives problem-solving and learning. Third, they practice strict discipline, though this may manifest differently for each person.

These traits combine to create exceptional results. While some billionaires might not be disciplined in all areas of life (some might be physically unfit or disorganized), they invariably demonstrate extraordinary discipline in their core business area. This focused excellence differentiates them from those with more scattered approaches to life and business.

## 8. Sales skills as wealth creation tools

Sales prowess, not technical expertise, is what truly created Robert's wealth. Despite being recognized as a cybersecurity expert, he attributes his financial success to his ability to sell effectively. This realization shifted his approach to business entirely.

The first sales lesson he learned was that you can't force people to buy something they fundamentally don't need. Instead of pushy tactics, he focused on creating value and building relationships. This approach to sales became the foundation of his business philosophy and wealth creation strategy, emphasizing genuine connections over manipulative techniques.

## 9. The journey from external to internal validation

Early in his career, Robert tied his self-worth to external symbols of wealth like cars and houses. In his 20s, he defined success by possessions, wanting a Corvette and to make $1,000 for each year of his age. These modest goals reflected his limited exposure to possibility.

His perspective evolved dramatically as he matured. Now he understands that these external markers don't bring fulfillment. He shifted from pursuing possessions to maximizing his potential and making an impact. This transformation from external validation to internal purpose represents a key element of his journey to true wealth and happiness.

## 10. The connection between joy and sustainable success

Joy is essential for sustainable success. Robert emphasizes that without joy, achievements feel hollow and often lead to self-destructive behaviors seen in many successful people. During his darkest period, reconnecting with joy was crucial to his recovery.

After experiencing profound depression despite his wealth, Robert learned that material success without joy is ultimately meaningless. He now counts joy among his most important values, alongside family and empowerment. This perspective helps explain how he maintains his characteristic energy and positive outlook despite challenges.

Through service work at a homeless mission, he rediscovered his sense of purpose and joy. This experience taught him that joy isn't a result of success but rather a foundation that makes success meaningful and sustainable. Without it, even the greatest achievements can feel empty.
