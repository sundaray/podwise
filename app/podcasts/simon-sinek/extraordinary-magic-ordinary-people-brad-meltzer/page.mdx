Here are the top 10 insights from Simon Sinek's conversation with bestselling author Brad Meltzer on how ordinary people create extraordinary impact through belief, persistence, and the courage to remain vulnerable.

## 1. Ordinary people change the world

Brad Meltzer's core belief centers on the transformative power of everyday individuals. This philosophy emerged from a profound moment when Simon Sinek helped him discover his "why" during their first meeting. Meltzer had been writing books about ordinary heroes for years without consciously realizing this was his central theme. His mother's reaction validated this truth: she told him he'd been like that since childhood.

This belief stems from Meltzer's own life experiences. He witnessed a neighbor named Mircy (which he heard as "Mercy") save his family from eviction by giving them her apartment. His high school friend Nick Wickett achieved his dream of training dolphins at SeaWorld despite coming from poverty. These real-life examples prove that extraordinary outcomes don't require extraordinary beginnings. They require determination and the willingness to reach beyond current circumstances.

## 2. Someone believing in you changes everything

The conversation reveals how crucial it is to have at least one person who sees your potential. For Meltzer, this person was his ninth-grade English teacher, Sheila Spicer. She told him three simple words: "You can write." She placed him in honors-level work despite scheduling conflicts and predicted he would thank her later.

This concept extends beyond mere encouragement. Research by Professor Jane Dutton shows that when someone we trust believes in us, we begin to become that person they envision. This "reflected best self portrait" creates a powerful psychological shift. The belief of others becomes a catalyst for transformation. It's not magic; it's the profound impact of human connection and faith. When Meltzer returned to thank his teacher with his first published book, she nearly retired thinking she hadn't made a difference. His visit proved that teachers often never know the lives they've changed.

## 3. Failure is the foundation of success

The Wright brothers exemplify the role of failure in achievement. They brought extra materials to every flight attempt because they knew they would crash. This wasn't pessimism; it was preparation. They understood that progress requires repeated failure. Meltzer himself received 24 rejection letters for his first book when only 20 publishers existed: some rejected him twice to emphasize their point.

Every morning when Meltzer sits down to write, he deliberately recalls his worst professional moment. He replays the phone call where his agent said "Sorry, kiddo" after his final two prospects rejected his book. This ritual keeps him hungry and grateful. It prevents complacency. The struggle itself becomes valuable. Without failure, success loses its meaning. The heroes in Meltzer's children's books always include their failures because that's where readers find hope and connection.

## 4. Passion alone isn't enough

The podcast challenges the common advice to "follow your passion." Both speakers agree this guidance, while true, is essentially useless without context. Passion requires what Sinek calls "full commitment to the bit." It demands persistence through rejection and disappointment. The people who succeed aren't just doing what they love; they're doing what they cannot help but do.

This distinction matters. Jane Goodall studied chimpanzees not just because she loved animals but because she couldn't imagine doing anything else. The same applied to Jim Henson with puppets and Amelia Earhart with planes. Success comes from combining passion with stubborn persistence. You need what Meltzer calls "that side order of stubbornness." Dreams require work. They require showing up after failure. They require continuing when everyone else would quit.

## 5. The human touch remains irreplaceable

Meltzer's daughter provided a profound insight about artificial intelligence: "AI doesn't have taste." When Meltzer tested whether AI could write one of his children's books, it could outline perfectly. It could structure the story. But it couldn't capture the quiet moment of a grandmother braiding Simone Biles' hair. It couldn't convey the feeling of being cared for through simple touch.

This limitation extends beyond technical capability. AI lacks lived experience. It has never felt loss, love, or loneliness. Meltzer won't finish a children's book until either he or his wife cries at the ending. This emotional resonance comes from accessing personal memories and universal human experiences. The best stories don't tell you about plot or character; they reveal something about yourself. A machine can mimic patterns but cannot feel the weight of a grandmother's gentle hands or understand why that moment matters more than Olympic gold medals.

## 6. Clark Kent matters more than Superman

Superman's enduring appeal doesn't come from his superpowers. It comes from Clark Kent. Two seventeen-year-old Jewish kids created Superman in 1938 as fascism threatened the world. The character sold millions because readers saw themselves in Clark: ordinary, overlooked, wishing they could do something extraordinary. When other publishers created caped heroes with similar powers, they failed. They missed the essential ingredient.

Clark Kent represents our daily reality. We're all mild-mannered people with hidden potential. The fantasy isn't really about lifting cars or flying; it's about mattering. It's about contributing something meaningful despite feeling ordinary. Ma and Pa Kent taught Superman that strength comes from the heart, not from muscles. This lesson resonates because we recognize our own struggles in Clark's dual identity. We understand hiding our true selves while longing to make a difference.

## 7. Spite makes a poor foundation

Using negative motivation creates an endless cycle of dissatisfaction. Meltzer initially fueled himself with the memory of a customer who said he'd work at HÃ¤agen-Dazs forever. But revenge-based motivation raises an unanswerable question: when is it enough? What achievement finally proves your worth? At what point do you declare victory?

Sinek identifies this as "villain motivation." It keeps you stuck in the past rather than moving toward the future. The people who truly succeed find positive reasons to continue. They're pulled by vision rather than pushed by resentment. Having someone believe in you provides infinite fuel. Having someone doubt you only works until you prove them wrong. Then what? The healthiest response to cruel criticism is often simple dismissal: "That's ridiculous." Save your energy for building rather than proving.

## 8. Vulnerability diminishes with success

Meltzer believes his first book remains his best because he wrote without knowing anyone would read it. This freedom allowed complete honesty. Once you know people are watching, something changes at the molecular level. A protective instinct emerges. You hold back just slightly. You guard against the criticism you now know exists.

This self-protection kills authenticity in art. At age fifty, Meltzer faced this problem directly. He analyzed his best work to identify common elements. He discovered his strongest books had the best characters. So he spent an extra six months developing characters for "The Escape Artist" rather than starting immediately. The book became his bestseller. The lesson: competing with your younger self requires conscious effort to remain vulnerable. You must choose exposure over safety.

## 9. Kindness and empathy require strength

During his University of Michigan commencement speech, Meltzer touched a cultural nerve. When he said cruelty and venom have become sport in our culture, 70,000 people erupted. He argued that mockery signals weakness, not strength. Real strength comes from switching places with others: the essence of empathy. The reaction surprised him. People contacted his family members requesting the speech text.

Our culture hungers for empathy and kindness. These aren't soft concepts; they demand courage. Looking through another's eyes requires abandoning your own perspective. Showing kindness when cruelty seems easier takes discipline. Meltzer connected this to magic tricks: empathy is the trick where two things switch places. You must fully commit to seeing from another's viewpoint. This full commitment transforms both people involved.

## 10. True purpose serves others

The conversation returns repeatedly to service. Magic isn't something you do for yourself; it's a gift you give others. Purpose means creating opportunities for people to serve those who serve others. Sheila Spicer changed Meltzer's life with three words. He carries her name forever. This is impact: when someone remembers you decades later because you saw their potential.

Most teachers never know their influence. They have thirty students; students have one teacher. The ratio ensures that transformative moments often go unrecognized. Yet these moments ripple outward. Meltzer became a writer who encourages millions of children to believe in their own potential. Sinek spreads optimism and inspiration globally. Both men continue the chain of service started by individuals who probably considered themselves ordinary. That's how ordinary people change the world: one person at a time, often without knowing it.
