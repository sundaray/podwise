Here are the top 10 key takeaways from Simon Sinek's conversation with cellist Anastasia Kobekina that reveal how she's revolutionizing classical music for modern audiences.

## 1. Making classical music accessible

Anastasia Kobekina approaches classical music with a fresh perspective that makes it more accessible to modern audiences. She believes classical music contains all the elements found in popular music—beautiful melodies and captivating harmonies—but it's often the formal structure that creates barriers for new listeners. Her innovative approach includes playing with more energy and even incorporating techniques like percussive elements on her cello.

Classical music's traditional formality can be intimidating for newcomers. Symphonies lasting 40 minutes and concerts structured in rigid formats can make it difficult for new audiences to connect. Kobekina breaks these barriers by bringing youthful energy and modern sensibilities to her performances, creating entry points for people who might otherwise find classical music unapproachable.

## 2. The playlist mentality

Simon Sinek observes that Kobekina's album represents a "playlist mentality" rather than following the traditional album format of classical music. Instead of including complete works with all movements, she selectively chooses individual movements that she finds most compelling. This approach aligns perfectly with how modern audiences consume music through streaming platforms where they create personalized playlists of favorite tracks.

Interestingly, Kobekina reveals this approach actually returns to older traditions. She mentions that in Beethoven's time and during Chopin's career, composers often performed only selected movements rather than complete works. This playlist approach makes classical music more digestible for contemporary listeners while ironically reconnecting with historical performance practices that were later abandoned in favor of rigid programming.

## 3. Music as emotional communication

Throughout the conversation, Kobekina consistently emphasizes music as a tool for emotional communication rather than simply reproducing compositions faithfully. She speaks about how different pieces help her express specific emotions and connect with audiences on a deeper level. This approach shifts the focus from technical perfection to emotional resonance.

Simon highlights that unlike many classical musicians who focus primarily on composer intentions or historical authenticity, Kobekina prioritizes what the audience feels and experiences. This perspective was evident in her childhood story about playing for her ill grandmother—using music to communicate feelings when words weren't enough. Her approach treats music as a living, emotional language rather than a museum artifact to be preserved.

## 4. Breaking traditions in performance

Kobekina demonstrates a willingness to break traditional performance practices. From "banging" on her cello during Vivaldi's concerto to adding vocal elements to her performances, she infuses classical pieces with contemporary energy and personal expression. These innovations make her interpretations unique and help classical music feel relevant to today's audiences.

Simon notes how Kobekina's unconventional approach, discovered through her viral Instagram performances, serves as a "gateway drug" for classical music appreciation. By freeing herself from rigid rules and frames, she creates performances that resonate with people who might not otherwise engage with classical music. This balance between respecting tradition while embracing innovation represents her distinctive contribution to keeping classical music vital.

## 5. Playing history

One particularly poignant moment occurs when Kobekina describes playing her Stradivarius cello from 1698 as "playing history." Despite acknowledging that modern instruments can sound nearly identical to historical ones, she values the connection to centuries of musical tradition that her instrument represents. The cello carries the legacy of countless musicians who played it before her and will continue to do so after.

This perspective reveals Kobekina's deep respect for musical heritage even as she innovates. She balances reverence for the past with a commitment to making music relevant for present audiences. Her approach doesn't reject tradition but rather builds upon it, recognizing that meaningful innovation requires understanding what came before.

## 6. Finding the flow in performance

Kobekina describes her performance experience as "catching the flow"—being completely present in the moment rather than thinking about the past or future. This state of flow allows her to shape music differently each time, responding to her current emotions and the audience's energy. She explains that even with Bach's well-known pieces, there are "millions of variations" possible in interpretation.

This ability to remain present transforms each performance into a unique experience. She compares it to telling a story where she can sense exactly how people are listening—whether they're fully engaged or only catching every third word. This mindfulness creates authentic connections during performances and prevents classical music from becoming mechanical reproduction.

## 7. The demanding lifestyle of a classical soloist

Simon and Kobekina discuss the challenging lifestyle of a classical soloist, which involves constant travel, brief rehearsals, and the pressure to perform at her best regardless of her emotional state. She describes the psychological preparation required before concerts—working through anxiety and introversion to reach a state of openness where she can genuinely connect with the audience.

This nomadic existence resembles that of stand-up comedians, as Simon observes. The conversation highlights the personal sacrifices involved in a classical music career, including impacts on social relationships and personal routines. Despite these challenges, Kobekina embraces the opportunity to create meaningful musical connections in each new venue.

## 8. The balance between virtuosity and accessibility

Though Kobekina began playing cello at age four, she admits she didn't practice regularly until around age nine or ten when pieces became more complex. Her early approach was playful rather than disciplined, focusing on enjoyment rather than technical perfection. This balance between serious musicianship and accessible enjoyment continues to characterize her professional career.

Simon identifies Kobekina as a prodigy whose natural talent allows her to maintain a lighter approach to preparation while still delivering exceptional performances. This combination of virtuosity with approachability makes her especially effective at bridging the gap between classical music expertise and new audience engagement.

## 9. Curating personal musical experiences

Kobekina expresses particular satisfaction with her Venice album because she had complete control over the program selection and artistic direction. Unlike many classical performances where repertoire is chosen by promoters, this project allowed her to create a deeply personal musical statement that crosses genre boundaries. She describes this artistic ownership as giving her "a very special feeling."

This desire to curate meaningful musical experiences extends beyond her recordings to her live performances. By selecting pieces that speak to her current emotional state and blending different musical traditions, she creates cohesive artistic statements. Her approach treats music as a unified art form rather than segregating it into rigid classical and contemporary categories.

## 10. Renewing classical music audiences

Simon concludes their conversation with a powerful observation about Kobekina's potential impact on classical music's future. He predicts that if she continues her approach, concert programming and audiences will transform dramatically within ten years. The current predominantly older audience will diversify to include younger people seeking emotional experiences rather than merely witnessing historical performances.

This vision of renewal addresses one of classical music's most pressing challenges—attracting new generations of listeners. By prioritizing emotional connection over tradition and treating classical music as a living art form rather than a museum piece, Kobekina represents a new direction for classical performance. Her approach suggests that classical music's future depends not on preserving the past exactly as it was, but on finding authentic ways to make it speak to contemporary audiences.
