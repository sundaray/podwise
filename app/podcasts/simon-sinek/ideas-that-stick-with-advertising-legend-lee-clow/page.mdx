Here are the top 10 key takeaways from Simon Sinek's conversation with advertising legend Lee Clow, the creative mind behind some of Apple's most iconic campaigns.

## 1. Visionary leadership drives exceptional creativity

Steve Jobs exemplified a rare form of leadership that pushed people beyond their perceived limitations. According to Lee Clow, Jobs could "see two horizons further than anyone else" and maintained extraordinarily high expectations. While many found his demanding style too challenging, those who embraced it accomplished things beyond what they believed possible.

This leadership style wasn't simply about being tough. Jobs also possessed the crucial ability to recognize greatness when he saw it. Unlike many executives who push people without clear direction, Jobs could identify when someone had achieved something truly exceptional. His combination of vision, high standards, and recognition created an environment where creativity flourished.

## 2. The decline of CEO involvement in creative direction

There has been a significant shift in how companies approach creative direction and advertising. In the past, CEOs like Steve Jobs maintained direct relationships with creative directors, meeting weekly to discuss advertising strategy. Jobs loved advertising and considered it integral to Apple's success, not just a departmental function.

Today, this level of CEO involvement in creative direction is exceedingly rare. Most modern companies are run by managers who view advertising as just another department to be managed. The creative vision that shaped iconic brands like Apple and Nike came from direct relationships between visionary CEOs and creative directors who shared a deep understanding of the brand's identity. This disconnect may explain why fewer companies are producing truly groundbreaking creative work today.

## 3. Trust in creativity versus reliance on data

One defining characteristic of exceptional leaders like Steve Jobs was their willingness to trust creativity and intuition. Most CEOs today are uncomfortable with creativity because it isn't rational or easily quantifiable. They prefer methodical approaches based on data rather than intuition.

Jobs stood apart because he embraced the unpredictable nature of creative work. He trusted his intuition and the intuition of his creative teams. This approach allowed Apple to take bold risks that more cautious companies wouldn't consider. The willingness to trust creativity over purely data-driven decisions was fundamental to Apple's ability to create revolutionary products and marketing campaigns.

## 4. The power of anthemic advertising

The 1984 Super Bowl commercial for Apple's Macintosh and the later "Think Different" campaign represent a form of advertising that transcended product promotion. These "anthem ads" were visual manifestos that communicated a company's core values, vision, and purpose. They weren't designed primarily to sell products but to establish a brand's identity and beliefs.

Clow laments that these types of bold, visionary advertisements have become increasingly rare. The changing media landscape has shifted focus toward more immediate, product-focused marketing. Though today's technology makes it impossible to skip ads on many platforms, few companies are using this captive audience to share meaningful brand manifestos. Instead, they focus on short-term sales rather than long-term brand building.

## 5. The importance of brand as identity

Successful brands become part of people's identity rather than just products they consume. Clow shared his experience with Jacobs surfboards, explaining that he "didn't want to just own their product" but wanted "that brand to be part of me because it said something about who I was." The ultimate achievement for a brand is when customers want to wear its logo as a badge of identity.

This concept led to what Clow and Sinek call the "swag test." If a company gave away free t-shirts with their logo, would people wear them proudly to social gatherings or only use them for painting the house? Brands that pass this test have transcended being mere products and have become symbols that people use to express their identity and values to others.

## 6. The legacy of the 1984 Apple commercial

The 1984 Apple commercial fundamentally changed Super Bowl advertising. Despite only airing once during the Super Bowl, it created a theatrical experience that inspired creative professionals worldwide. It showed that bold, artistic advertising during high-profile events could justify the enormous expense.

The commercial was revolutionary not just for its cinematic quality but because it introduced a completely new type of product. Unlike promoting "another soda pop," Apple was introducing a computer with a graphical user interface that would transform computing forever. The combination of Ridley Scott's direction, a groundbreaking product, and a bold narrative created an advertisement that continues to be discussed and analyzed decades after it aired.

## 7. Finding a brand's unique voice

Successful marketing requires finding a brand's distinctive personality and voice. When Clow's team worked on Gatorade, they transformed it from a struggling brand into "G," creating a cultural touchpoint. Their work with Energizer created the iconic bunny that "keeps going and going," a phrase that entered the cultural lexicon.

The key to creating these iconic campaigns was identifying what made each product special and finding a creative way to express its unique qualities. Clow suggests that the most successful brands find ways to become "culturally cool" and "culturally relevant" through the stories they tell and how they tell them. This approach can refresh established brands or help new ones find their voice in crowded marketplaces.

## 8. The impact of mentorship on creative development

Early recognition and encouragement of creative talent can have lifelong effects. Clow shared a touching story about his kindergarten teacher telling his mother he had artistic ability and to "never let him lose that." This early recognition set him on a path where his mother continuously supported his creative development despite his father's practical concerns.

This theme of mentorship and pushing people to realize their potential runs throughout Clow's career. From his own experience being encouraged as a child to his work with Steve Jobs pushing creative teams beyond their comfort zones, Clow demonstrates how identifying and nurturing talent leads to exceptional results. The right kind of push from mentors, teachers, and leaders can help people accomplish more than they believe possible.

## 9. Changing media landscape and advertising challenges

The fragmentation of media has fundamentally changed how advertising reaches people. Television's dominance has declined, replaced by digital platforms that deliver more targeted but often less impactful messages. Clow notes that while old television commercials interrupted content, they could still capture attention through creative excellence.

Today's digital ads also interrupt content, but most are "pretty ignorable" despite being unavoidable. The challenge for modern advertisers is creating content so "captivating and interesting that people want to share it." Clow believes the next generation of creative media artists will find ways to create meaningful brand messages within these new platforms, but it requires content compelling enough that people actively want to engage with it rather than simply enduring it.

## 10. The soul of a brand

The "Think Different" campaign represented more than just advertising—it recaptured the essential character of Apple when the company was struggling to survive. When Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, he needed to remind people what the company stood for before new products were ready. The campaign articulated that Apple made "tools for people who want to change the world."

The iconic "Here's to the crazy ones" text wasn't written solely by Jobs or Clow but emerged through extensive collaboration. They created numerous versions, with Jobs pushing and refining until they captured the perfect expression of Apple's soul. This campaign wasn't just about rebuilding Apple's image; it was about reminding everyone—customers, developers, and employees—what made Apple special in the first place. The campaign provided the foundation for Apple's remarkable comeback.
