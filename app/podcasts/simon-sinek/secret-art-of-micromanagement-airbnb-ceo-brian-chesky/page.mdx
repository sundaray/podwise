Here are the top 10 leadership insights from Brian Chesky's conversation with Simon Sinek that reveal how Airbnb's success stems from rejecting conventional business wisdom and embracing a founder's mindset.

## 1. Leadership is a continuous journey

Brian Chesky emphasizes that leadership is not an innate skill but something that must be learned and practiced. He shares his personal experience of starting Airbnb at 26 without any leadership models to follow. His parents were social workers, and he had no corporate background to draw from, making his leadership journey one of continuous discovery and learning.

Brian maintains that even after building Airbnb into an $80 billion company, he still considers himself a student of leadership. He makes an important distinction between being a founder and being a CEO, noting that founding a company felt relatively intuitive to him, while being an effective CEO required significant learning and adaptation. This humble perspective about constantly improving as a leader appears to be central to his approach.

## 2. Make something people want

One of the fundamental principles Brian learned was to focus on creating products that people genuinely desire rather than chasing growth metrics. He references the Y Combinator mantra "make something people want" as the best starting point for any business. This straightforward advice kept Airbnb focused on creating genuine value rather than getting distracted by investor expectations.

During the pandemic crisis, when Airbnb lost 80% of its business in eight weeks, Brian returned to this core principle. Rather than focusing on artificial growth metrics, he directed the company to make hundreds of small improvements to their product. He emphasizes that customers don't care about a company's growth statistics or success. They only care about how the product or service enriches their own lives.

## 3. Founder mode versus manager mindset

Brian discusses the concept of "founder mode," which contrasts with a typical manager mindset. In founder mode, leaders stay deeply involved in the details of the business without micromanaging. He compares it to a general who fights alongside troops on the battlefield, maintaining enough proximity to understand challenges and provide support while still trusting their team.

The founder mode approach also emphasizes getting an entire organization to move in the same direction. Brian says he'd rather have "a thousand people in one ship than a thousand people in a thousand little boats going in different directions." This approach contrasts with how many Fortune 500 companies operate, where businesses are managed primarily through numbers, divided into separate divisions, and CEOs remain disconnected from operational details.

## 4. Eyes on, hands off

Brian introduces the leadership principle of "eyes on, hands off," which he learned from General McChrystal of Joint Special Operations Command. This approach allows leaders to maintain awareness of what's happening in their organization without directly controlling every aspect. It creates space for autonomy while maintaining standards and alignment.

The "eyes on" component ensures leaders remain informed and can provide support when needed. Meanwhile, the "hands off" aspect demonstrates trust in team members' abilities and provides them room to execute in their own way. Brian stresses that being "eyes on" doesn't equate to micromanagement because you're not necessarily "hands on" with the work.

## 5. Leadership as partnership

Brian challenges the traditional hierarchical notion of leadership, reframing it as a creative partnership. When asked if Steve Jobs micromanaged, Johnny Ive reportedly said no, because "he was partnering with me." This distinction between directing versus partnering is subtle but profound in how it shapes workplace dynamics.

The partnership approach means no clear division between "your job" and "my job." Instead, Brian encourages thinking about it as "we do the job together." This collaborative mindset allows the leader to add value without taking over. The leader brings perspective, asks questions, connects dots across departments, and challenges assumptions, all while respecting the expertise of team members.

Brian notes that in a functional organization, he can't tell specialists exactly how to do their jobs because he lacks their expertise. Instead, he communicates desired outcomes, questions whether they're pushing boundaries, and facilitates cross-functional collaboration. This creates a genuine partnership where everyone contributes their strengths to achieve a shared goal.

## 6. Crisis reveals leadership character

The COVID-19 pandemic, which devastated the travel industry, became a defining moment for Brian's leadership. He shares how one board member told him this crisis was like "ten 9/11s at once" for their business. In this extreme situation, Brian learned that managing his own psychology was the most crucial factor in successfully navigating the crisis.

Brian observed that a leader's mental state becomes the organization's psychology. If leaders ask "why me?" or look to employees for reassurance, that fearful mentality permeates the company. Instead, he approached the crisis by asking how he wanted to be remembered, committing to being bold, courageous, and optimistic. This mindset created space for creativity and bravery within the organization.

During the crisis, Brian increased communication with both the board and employees, holding weekly all-hands meetings where he answered every question honestly. He radically simplified the company, cutting 70-80% of projects and making the difficult decision to lay off 25% of employees. Throughout this process, he remained personally involved rather than delegating difficult decisions, reviewing every person affected by layoffs and ensuring the company provided generous support to those departing.

## 7. Action beats analysis in crisis

Brian emphasizes that decisive action is crucial during crises, especially when data is limited or unreliable. He observed that people who rely heavily on data often struggle during times of rapid change because they must instead rely on intuition. Creating pros and cons lists or waiting for perfect information can be paralytic in crisis situations.

The Airbnb team focused on making fast, bold decisions during the pandemic. Brian compares crisis decision-making to driving on a highway: hesitating between exits is more dangerous than committing to a path. This decisive approach helped Airbnb navigate through extreme uncertainty when their entire business model was threatened.

Brian established clear crisis principles with his board: act decisively, preserve cash, be heroes rather than villains of the crisis, and prepare to win the following travel season. These guardrails enabled quick decision-making without requiring board approval for every move, allowing the company to respond with agility to rapidly changing circumstances.

## 8. Recruiting for challenge

Brian advocates for transparent recruiting that attracts people who desire challenges rather than comfort. He references Ernest Shackleton's famous Antarctic expedition advertisement: "Men wanted for hazardous journey. Small wages, bitter cold, long months of complete darkness, constant danger, safe return doubtful, honor and recognition in case of success." This transparent approach attracted adventurers who understood and welcomed the challenges ahead.

Brian believes in recruiting people who "like to do the impossible" and want to push beyond their limits. Rather than having recruiters function as salespeople who minimize challenges, he prefers honest communication about the demanding nature of the work. This transparency ensures that those who join are aligned with the company's ethos and prepared for the journey.

He notes that this approach isn't for everyone, and that's precisely the point. A company's values should function as a filter, attracting those who resonate with its approach and deterring those who don't. If everyone agrees with your values and culture, they probably don't stand for much.

## 9. Effort over inherent talent

Brian shares how his father raised him by rewarding effort rather than innate talent, which research now supports as promoting a growth mindset. When children are praised for being inherently smart or talented, they often become afraid to try new things that might disprove that fixed identity. Conversely, when effort is praised, the only way to fail is by not giving your all.

This approach shapes how Brian leads. He references UCLA basketball coach John Wooden, who asked players simply to do their very best. The secret was that Wooden saw potential in players that they couldn't see in themselves. Similarly, Brian believes a leader's role is to help people reach beyond what they think possible.

Brian suggests that telling someone "you could do better" isn't saying they aren't good enough. Instead, it communicates that the leader sees untapped potential. The greatest gift a leader can give is belief in someone's capabilities, which sometimes manifests as pushing them to achieve more than they thought possible.

## 10. Culture as unique differentiation

Brian defines culture not as superficial perks like food or yoga classes, but as "the unique way that you do things that distinguish you from everyone else." He argues that companies typically have either strong cultures or weak ones, with weak cultures lacking a shared understanding of how things should be done.

Strong cultures serve as both a compass and a filter. They guide decision-making and help attract those who resonate with the company's approach while deterring those who don't. Brian believes that leaders should be authentic to their own leadership style rather than trying to find a middle ground between how they want to lead and how others want to be led.

This perspective challenges leaders to be introspective about their preferred leadership approach and then clearly communicate it. The alternative—hiring people from ten different companies who each bring their own way of working—results in an ineffective compromise between different methodologies. A strong culture creates clarity and alignment that drives the organization forward with purpose and distinctive character.
