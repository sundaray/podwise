Here are the top 10 key takeaways from Ed Mylett's interview with WWE Hall of Famer Titus O'Neil, whose incredible journey from trauma to triumph offers profound lessons on resilience, faith, and transforming pain into purpose.

## 1. Belief creates transformation more powerfully than love alone

The distinction between being loved and being believed in represents a fundamental difference in human impact. When Patrick Manogue told the troubled 12-year-old Titus "I love you and I believe in you," it was the belief component that proved transformational. Most people can name numerous individuals who have loved them throughout their lives. However, the list of people who have genuinely believed in their potential is typically much shorter.

Belief empowers people to attempt things they would never otherwise try. It provides courage and strength to step beyond comfort zones and pursue possibilities that seemed impossible. When someone believes in you, they're not just accepting who you are now but investing in who you could become. This forward-looking perspective creates a powerful psychological foundation for growth and achievement.

The impact of belief extends beyond personal development into leadership and parenting. As fathers, mothers, and leaders, expressing genuine belief in others becomes one of the most significant gifts we can offer. It's not enough to simply love someone; we must also communicate our confidence in their abilities and potential for greatness.

## 2. Our test becomes our testimony when we choose transformation

The concept that "our mess becomes our message" represents a fundamental principle of personal growth and service to others. Rather than allowing traumatic experiences to define us negatively, we can transform them into sources of strength and tools for helping others. This transformation requires a conscious decision to view our struggles as preparation for future ministry to others who face similar challenges.

Titus exemplifies this principle through his journey from a product of sexual assault to a philanthropist who has helped hundreds of children attend college. His traumatic beginning didn't disqualify him from greatness; instead, it equipped him with unique compassion and understanding for other struggling youth. The very circumstances that could have destroyed him became the foundation for his greatest contributions to society.

This perspective shift from victim to victor requires recognizing that our painful experiences often position us to help others in ways that those without such experiences cannot. When we embrace our story rather than hide from it, we discover that our greatest wounds can become our most powerful tools for healing others.

## 3. Forgiveness transforms hatred into understanding and love

The revelation of how he was conceived at age 17 marked a pivotal moment in Titus's relationship with his mother. Instead of increasing his anger, learning that his mother was raped at 11 and gave birth at 12 instantly transformed his hatred into love and understanding. This shift occurred because he finally understood the context of their difficult relationship and his mother's struggles.

Forgiveness becomes possible when we recognize that hurt people hurt people. His mother's behavior throughout his childhood wasn't about him but about her own unprocessed trauma and the impossible situation of being a child raising children. Understanding this context allowed him to extend grace rather than judgment.

The power of forgiveness extends beyond personal healing to break generational cycles of pain. By choosing to forgive and understand rather than perpetuate anger, we create space for healing and growth. This choice often requires seeing the humanity in those who have hurt us and recognizing that they too are products of their circumstances and experiences.

## 4. Every setback contains a setup for future success

The perspective that everyone gets "fired" from something in life reframes failure as a natural part of growth rather than a final verdict. Whether it's the end of a relationship, career, or dream, these transitions serve as setup phases for what comes next. The key lies in understanding that there's always a promotion waiting on the other side of what appears to be a setback.

During transition periods, learning to rest becomes crucial for eventual success. These seemingly unproductive times serve as necessary detox and rebuilding phases. They provide opportunities to reflect, heal, and prepare for the next chapter. Without these rest periods, we often jump from one situation to another without learning the lessons necessary for long-term success.

The ability to pivot and transition successfully requires submitting to a larger plan rather than rigidly adhering to our own limited vision. Sometimes what we think we want isn't what we actually need. By remaining open to unexpected opportunities and directions, we position ourselves to receive blessings and opportunities we couldn't have imagined or planned for ourselves.

## 5. Attitude determines longevity in competitive environments

Success in highly competitive environments like the WWE or Division I football comes down to attitude more than raw talent. When people believe they're bigger than the team, company, or relationship, they inevitably fail. This principle applies across all areas of life, from professional sports to business to personal relationships.

Treating everyone from the CEO to the janitor with equal respect demonstrates the kind of character that leads to sustained success. Those who get caught up in their own hype and start believing they're superior to others quickly find themselves on the outside looking in. The entertainment industry, like many competitive fields, can create anyone into a star, but maintaining that status requires humility and professionalism.

The WWE environment, with its demanding travel schedule and constant performance pressure, serves as a proving ground for character. Those who can maintain their attitude and work ethic while performing 52 weeks a year in front of crowds ranging from 10,000 to 85,000 people develop skills that translate to success in any field. The key is remembering that success is a privilege, not a right, and treating it accordingly.

## 6. Decision-making power transforms victims into victors

The twins exercise illustrates how two people from identical traumatic backgrounds can end up in completely different places based on the decisions they make. Both twins experienced abuse, alcoholic fathers, and the foster care system. Yet one became successful while the other repeatedly found trouble. When asked why they ended up where they did, both responded, "With a father like mine, I had no other choice."

This paradox reveals that our circumstances don't determine our destiny; our decisions do. Every day presents opportunities to choose our response to life's challenges. Some people accept help and use it to recover and grow, while others choose to remain trapped in their circumstances. The difference lies not in what happens to us but in how we choose to respond.

The power of decision extends beyond our immediate circumstances to influence generational patterns. By choosing to break cycles of abuse, neglect, or dysfunction, we create new possibilities not just for ourselves but for future generations. This requires recognizing that we have more power over our lives than we often realize and taking responsibility for exercising that power wisely.

## 7. Intentional vulnerability creates authentic connection and healing

Sharing personal struggles and traumas requires courage but creates opportunities for authentic connection and healing. When Titus openly discusses his origin story and challenges, he doesn't diminish his strength but demonstrates it. True strength lies not in hiding our wounds but in transforming them into sources of wisdom and compassion for others.

Vulnerability in leadership and parenting involves giving honest explanations rather than demanding blind obedience. Instead of telling children "because I said so," effective parents explain the reasoning behind their decisions. This approach respects the child's intelligence while providing the context needed for good decision-making in the future.

The willingness to be vulnerable often inspires others to face their own challenges with greater courage. When successful people share their struggles, it normalizes the experience of difficulty and provides hope for those currently facing similar challenges. This creates a cycle of healing where those who have overcome help others do the same.

## 8. Fatherhood extends beyond biology to intentional investment

The decision to adopt Leah demonstrates that fatherhood is about intentional choice and commitment rather than biological connection. When her mother faced health challenges, Titus chose to step into a father role for a young woman he had known since she was seven. This decision was based on love, not obligation, and demonstrates the power of chosen family relationships.

Effective parenting involves accepting children as they are while helping them become the best versions of themselves. When Leah revealed her sexual orientation, Titus's response focused on character rather than identity. His requirement was simple: be a great human being. This unconditional acceptance combined with high standards creates an environment where children can thrive.

The impact of intentional fatherhood extends beyond individual families to break generational cycles and create new possibilities. By choosing to be the father he never had, Titus models healthy masculinity and provides stability that enables his children to pursue their dreams. This investment in the next generation creates ripple effects that extend far beyond the immediate family.

## 9. Faith requires action and obedience beyond belief

The distinction between being a believer and being a person of faith lies in the translation of belief into action. Many people believe in God, but fewer demonstrate that faith through consistent obedience and love-driven behavior. True faith manifests through actions that align with stated beliefs, even when those actions are difficult or costly.

Faith provides the courage to move forward without having all the details or understanding the complete plan. This requires trusting in a larger purpose and being willing to step into uncertainty based on spiritual conviction rather than complete understanding. Such faith often leads to opportunities and outcomes that couldn't have been achieved through human planning alone.

The practical application of faith involves responding to worldly issues differently than those operating purely from human wisdom. This means avoiding extreme positions and instead approaching situations with love, grace, and understanding. Faith-driven responses often surprise others because they prioritize relationship and human dignity over winning arguments or defending positions.

## 10. Purpose emerges from pain when properly processed

The journey from trauma to purpose requires proper processing of painful experiences rather than suppression or denial. Titus's willingness to explore his origins, despite the discomfort involved, demonstrates the importance of understanding our full story. This process involves asking difficult questions and facing uncomfortable truths about our past and the people who shaped us.

Healing often requires forgiveness of those who have caused us pain, even when they don't deserve it or haven't asked for it. This forgiveness isn't about excusing harmful behavior but about freeing ourselves from the burden of carrying hatred and resentment. Such forgiveness creates space for growth and enables us to help others who face similar challenges.

The transformation of pain into purpose creates a powerful platform for serving others. When we properly process our experiences, we develop unique insights and compassion that equip us to help others navigate similar challenges. This creates meaning from meaningless suffering and turns our greatest struggles into our most valuable contributions to the world.
