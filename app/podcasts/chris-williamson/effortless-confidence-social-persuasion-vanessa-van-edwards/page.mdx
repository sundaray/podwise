Here are the top 10 key takeaways from Vanessa Van Edwards' masterclass on confidence, charisma, and social dynamics that will transform how you communicate and connect with others.

## 1. Hand visibility builds trust

When meeting people, making your hands visible is crucial for building trust. Our brains instinctively look at hands first when meeting someone new to assess intentions and safety. This primal reaction stems from our evolutionary need to determine if others pose a threat.

On video calls, keeping hands visible becomes even more important because their absence can trigger the amygdala to fire warning signals. Experts recommend not only making hands visible but using them purposefully to emphasize points. Research on TED talks found that the most popular presentations featured 465 gestures on average in 18 minutes, compared to just 272 gestures in less popular talks.

## 2. The power of purposeful gestures

Effective communicators use their hands to create visual representations of their verbal content. When speakers match their gestures to their words—such as showing three fingers when mentioning three ideas or using expansive gestures for big concepts—they dramatically improve audience comprehension. This dual-channel communication helps listeners process information more efficiently.

Our brains actually prioritize visual cues over verbal ones. If someone says they have a "big idea" while making a small gesture, people are more likely to believe the gesture than the words. This misalignment can create confusion and undermine your message. Matching gestures to content creates a form of visual outline that helps listeners track and understand your points.

## 3. Pre-performance routines trigger winning states

Before important presentations or social interactions, strategic preparation can change your "chemical cocktail" for optimal performance. Listening to specific music that reminds you of past successes can help trigger positive emotional states. Using achievement-oriented words like "success," "win," and "achieve" in your self-talk can significantly improve performance outcomes.

Research shows that participants who read instructions containing achievement-oriented words performed better on intelligence tasks, spent twice as much time working on them, and enjoyed them more. Another study revealed that singing performance improved when participants stated "I'm excited" beforehand, regardless of how they actually felt. This demonstrates how reframing nervousness as excitement creates a self-fulfilling prophecy of success.

Laughter also helps prepare for performance by opening up the body, lowering vocal register, and improving breathing. The physical expansiveness that comes with laughter counteracts the contracted postures associated with losing or anxiety. This expansion helps boost confidence and improve vocal performance.

## 4. Body language affects mindset

The way we position our bodies directly influences our psychological state and performance capabilities. Winners naturally take up space, tilt their heads up, and maintain open postures, while losers contract, roll their shoulders inward, and take up minimal space. These physical states affect hormone levels—expansive postures increase testosterone and decrease cortisol.

When preparing for presentations, many speakers make the mistake of hunching over notes or devices, which restricts breathing and vocal power. This contracted position typically results in starting with vocal fry or question inflection, immediately diminishing their vocal charisma. Maintaining open, expansive postures before speaking helps ensure strong vocal delivery from the first word.

Research from the University of British Columbia comparing winning and losing athletes confirms these patterns across cultures and genders. The physical position you adopt before performance matters significantly—it's not just about how you look, but how your body position affects your hormonal state and subsequent performance.

## 5. Vocal charisma improves persuasiveness

Speaking from the lowest part of your natural vocal range dramatically increases your persuasiveness. This technique works by maximizing the distance between earlobes and shoulders while taking deep breaths to relax the vocal cords. Speaking on the outbreath rather than the inbreath produces a more authoritative, trustworthy sound.

People frequently make the mistake of beginning statements at the top of their breath, resulting in a higher-pitched, less authoritative sound. The solution is to take a deep breath and begin speaking during the exhale. Another common vocal issue is vocal fry—that grating, rattling sound that occurs when vocal cords rub together due to shallow breathing and low volume.

Dynamic volume also serves as a powerful communication tool. Using slightly higher volume for authoritative statements or exciting information naturally draws listener attention. Conversely, lowering volume for intimate, vulnerable, or surprising information creates a sense of closeness and often causes listeners to lean in. These techniques help speakers maintain audience engagement and emphasize important points.

## 6. Breaking small talk patterns creates better connections

Traditional small talk questions like "How are you?" and "What do you do?" consistently receive the lowest ratings in conversation satisfaction studies. These autopilot questions trigger equally autopilot responses, creating dull, forgettable interactions. Breaking these social scripts by asking more engaging questions instantly elevates conversations.

The most highly-rated conversation starter is "What was the highlight of your day?" This question not only breaks the social script but also prompts positive reflection. Other effective alternatives include "Working on anything exciting recently?" and "What personal passion project are you working on?" These questions create permission for people to discuss what genuinely interests them rather than what defines their professional identity.

These alternative questions work because they engage people's authentic interests while avoiding the judgmental undertones of traditional questions like "What do you do?" which can feel like asking "What are you worth?" For introverts who struggle with small talk due to using fewer daily words, having specific alternative questions prepared can make social interactions significantly less draining.

## 7. Charisma requires balancing warmth and competence

High achievers often mistakenly believe that excellent ideas and strong competence alone will translate to social effectiveness. However, research shows that competence without warmth creates suspicion. Truly charismatic people balance both qualities and adapt them depending on their audience.

The classic example is Jamie Siminoff, founder of Ring, who pitched his billion-dollar idea on Shark Tank but received no deals. Despite having strong numbers and a well-rehearsed pitch, he appeared emotionally muted, making the investors uncomfortable with investing in him. Smart people sometimes neglect non-verbal communication, assuming their ideas will stand on their own merit.

Both warmth and competence can be deliberately signaled through specific verbal and non-verbal cues. Warmth can be demonstrated through head tilts, nods, and genuine smiles that engage the upper cheek muscles. Competence is conveyed through direct gaze, especially at the end of important points, and measured, purposeful speech. Mastering both elements creates the most persuasive communication style.

## 8. Trust is undermined by specific behaviors

Research from Cornell University identified four behaviors that immediately trigger mistrust in others. Hand-to-face touching ranks high on this list, particularly when it involves rubbing movements rather than still, pensive poses. These movements often indicate discomfort with what's being said.

Lie detection research reveals why these behaviors create mistrust. Liars often cover their mouths instinctively as if trying to hold back information. Eye blocking (covering or rubbing eyes) suggests shame or unwillingness to witness something. Nose touching increases during deception, possibly due to tingling sensations triggered by guilt.

Other trust-reducing behaviors include touching the stomach or torso (a blocking behavior), ringing or rubbing hands, and sudden crossing of arms. While none of these behaviors definitively indicate lying, clusters of these "red flags" warrant attention, especially when they appear during specific topics or questions.

## 9. Creating "friendship allergies" reduces social anxiety

Rather than trying to connect with everyone, identifying specific compatibility factors helps find genuine connections faster. People who suffer from social anxiety often misinterpret neutral facial expressions as negative due to past experiences, particularly with critical or narcissistic parents. This misinterpretation leads to unnecessary social withdrawal.

Creating "friendship allergies"—specific questions or topics that quickly identify compatibility—saves emotional energy and reduces rejection anxiety. For example, asking about goals for the upcoming year quickly reveals whether someone shares your goal-oriented approach to life. This strategy shifts focus from "Will they like me?" to "Are we compatible?" making rejection less personal.

The realization that not everyone needs to like you can be liberating. Identifying incompatibility early prevents wasting social energy on forced connections. This approach is particularly helpful for introverts and those with limited social batteries, as it directs their energy toward potentially rewarding relationships rather than trying to win over everyone they meet.

## 10. Attractiveness is about signaling availability

Physical attraction depends less on appearance and more on signaling non-verbal availability. Research shows that people generally underestimate their attraction signals' effectiveness, assuming others can read their interest when most cues go unnoticed. This "signal amplification bias" means we need to be more obvious with our interest signals than we think.

Studies in bar settings found that women who were approached most frequently weren't necessarily the most conventionally attractive but those who displayed the most availability cues. Effective signals include darting glances (quick looks followed by looking away) and lingering gazes. Research suggests it takes approximately 17 such signals before someone typically approaches in heterosexual dating scenarios.

Low-pressure verbal cues like a simple "hey" with lowered voice tone and lingering gaze can quickly test potential interest without risking significant rejection. The fear of rejection prevents many people from signaling availability, but social exposure therapy—repeatedly facing mild rejection situations—gradually reduces anxiety. The potential reward of connection outweighs the minimal consequences of subtle rejection.
