Here are 15 powerful insights from George Mack on developing high agency to take control of your destiny and shape your own reality rather than letting life happen to you.

## 1. High agency is about happening to life versus life happening to you

High agency is characterized by individuals who actively shape their reality rather than being passive recipients of circumstances. George Mack describes it as "are they happening to life or is life happening to them?" This fundamental distinction separates high agency people from low agency people.

High agency is described as one of the most underdiscussed yet important ideas of the 21st century. Once you recognize this concept, you begin to see it everywhere in your life and throughout history. It's a perspective that completely changes how you view human potential and achievement.

## 2. There's no unsolvable problem unless it defies the laws of physics

A core belief of high agency people is that all problems are solvable if they don't violate the laws of physics. This isn't motivational self-help talk but rather a recognition of what's theoretically possible with enough knowledge and persistence.

This mindset allows high agency individuals to approach seemingly impossible challenges with confidence. Rather than accepting conventional limitations, they break problems down to first principles and work methodically toward solutions. The Wright brothers serve as a perfect example—they tackled human flight by methodically solving each component problem despite widespread belief it was impossible.

## 3. Adults don't exist

The concept that "adults don't exist" challenges the idea that there are authority figures who have everything figured out. High agency people recognize that everyone is figuring things out as they go along, regardless of their age or position.

This realization frees you from waiting for permission or validation from supposed authority figures. Once you understand that nobody truly has all the answers, you become more willing to trust your own judgment and take action. It removes artificial barriers created by deference to imagined expertise.

## 4. There's no guarantee you won't die screaming

This stark perspective serves as a powerful motivator for high agency. The recognition of mortality—and potentially difficult endings—pushes people to take meaningful action rather than postponing their ambitions.

George shares a story about filmmaker Kevin Smith, whose father died suddenly and painfully despite living conventionally and responsibly. This realization prompted Smith to pursue his creative ambitions despite the risks. The recognition that even "playing it safe" offers no guarantees frees people to pursue what truly matters to them without delay.

## 5. There's no one right way

High agency people understand there are multiple valid approaches to success. George uses the example of tennis greats Federer, Nadal, and Djokovic, who achieved similar levels of success through completely different training styles and personalities.

This principle extends to creative work as well. Bob Dylan could write a masterpiece in 15 minutes while Leonard Cohen might spend seven years perfecting a single song. High agency individuals don't get trapped searching for the "correct" formula. They find the approach that works for their unique circumstances and personality.

## 6. There's no memory of normal

People only remember what's distinctive and unique. Conforming to perceived norms eventually leads to being forgotten, while taking the risk to be different creates lasting impact.

This principle encourages authenticity and originality over fitting in. George suggests that attempts to follow conventional paths often lead to regret, while embracing your unique approach—even if initially uncomfortable—creates more meaningful outcomes. Only the irrational behavior survives in memory.

## 7. The education system is designed for low agency

The education system in both America and the UK operates on a model that trains students to be passive recipients rather than active shapers of their learning. George describes how schools use Pavlovian conditioning, standardized curriculum, and permission-seeking behaviors that discourage independent thinking.

This system was originally designed to create industrial factory workers, not high agency individuals. The focus on memorization, following orders, and standardized testing over critical thinking and creativity actively suppresses agency. The negative impact continues into adulthood as people struggle to unlearn these patterns of dependency.

## 8. Society tends to reward conformity rather than high agency

Darren Brown's experiment with people standing and sitting at the sound of a bell illustrates how powerfully social compliance influences behavior. People will follow the crowd even when there's no logical reason to do so.

This pressure toward conformity creates a significant barrier to high agency. Taking independent action often means standing out and risking social disapproval. High agency requires the courage to resist these powerful social currents and think independently, like the man who refused to salute Hitler when everyone around him did.

## 9. High agency has four foundational pillars

George identifies four core components that support high agency: clear thinking, resourcefulness, bias toward action, and disagreeability. These elements work together to enable individuals to shape their circumstances rather than be shaped by them.

Clear thinking involves cutting through confusion to identify what's truly important. Resourcefulness combines creativity with persistence to find novel solutions. Bias toward action means moving quickly rather than overthinking. Disagreeability allows you to question conventional wisdom when it doesn't make sense.

## 10. Low agency traps prevent people from taking control

George identifies several common "low agency traps" that keep people stuck. These include the "Midwit trap" (overthinking and overcomplicating simple solutions), the "vague trap" (avoiding specific goals to prevent failure), and the "cynic trap" (dismissing possibilities before trying).

These mental patterns create self-imposed limitations that prevent people from exercising agency. They provide psychological comfort by removing responsibility but ultimately restrict growth and achievement. Recognizing these patterns is the first step to overcoming them.

## 11. Specificity is essential for high agency

Vagueness prevents accountability and meaningful action. High agency individuals set specific goals with clear criteria for success and failure, which creates direction instead of anxiety.

George contrasts general ambition, which produces anxiety, with specific ambition, which produces direction. Specific criteria create measurable benchmarks for progress and force you to confront reality rather than hide in comforting ambiguity. This precision allows high agency people to make concrete progress where others remain stuck.

## 12. Break big goals into small, achievable steps

George recommends using what he calls the "video game Apple note" approach. This involves breaking intimidating goals into tiny, manageable first steps—like level one in a video game—that aren't overwhelming and provide quick dopamine hits when completed.

The key insight is that all complex achievements, from opening mail to building airplanes, can begin with a simple first step like "dump down thoughts on topic." Each completed step builds momentum for the next one. This approach counters the tendency to set goals at "level 56" difficulty, which leads to frustration and abandonment.

## 13. Test your disagreement muscles regularly

One exercise for developing high agency is to identify what you disagree with about people you admire. This practice strengthens your ability to think independently rather than outsourcing your beliefs to authority figures.

Another approach is to identify your strongest held opinions and then seek out the best arguments from the opposing side. This mental flexibility prevents ideological capture and builds confidence in your own judgment. High agency requires this willingness to question even ideas that feel comfortable.

## 14. View the present with a historian's frame

High agency people try to view current situations with the detachment of a future historian. This perspective helps cut through the emotional fog of the moment to see what's truly significant.

This approach involves asking how your current actions will look five years from now, or how historians might interpret today's events decades later. It provides valuable distance from immediate concerns and helps prioritize what matters most. This perspective shift often reveals that current worries are less important than they feel.

## 15. Inverse charisma builds stronger connections

Rather than trying to be the most interesting person in the room, focus on making others feel interesting. This "inverse charisma" approach creates deeper connections and goodwill than traditional charisma.

The most well-liked people aren't necessarily those who are most interesting themselves, but those who make others feel seen and valued. This approach involves asking open-ended questions rather than closed ones, and genuinely caring about the answers. It creates a positive-sum game where both parties benefit from the interaction.
