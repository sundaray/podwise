Here are the top 10 key takeaways from Will Ahmed's discussion with Chris Williamson that reveal crucial insights about fitness trends, entrepreneurship, and achieving peak performance.

## 1. The decline of CrossFit

CrossFit experienced a significant decline over the past few years after reaching its peak around 2017-2018. What began as a grassroots movement that started as an email list eventually faced major challenges, including controversy surrounding founder Greg Glassman's comments during the Black Lives Matter movement.

Will Ahmed, founder of Whoop, described CrossFit as "the most dysfunctional partner" his company has ever worked with. He expressed that CrossFit's downfall represented a huge missed opportunity in the fitness industry. The internal operations were described as a "dumpster fire" despite having a great community and brand, which are typically resilient elements when things go wrong.

## 2. Current fitness industry trends

According to data collected through Whoop, the biggest uptick in fitness activities in 2023 was Pickleball, while in 2024 it has been Paddle (known internationally as Padel). Both are racket sports, with Pickleball growing significantly in the United States and Paddle taking off internationally.

Ahmed described Paddle as a hybrid between squash and tennis played in glass courts, making it a dynamic and fun game. This data comes from tracking percentage increases of activities on the Whoop platform, essentially functioning as a "fitness trend aggregator." These trends show how newer activities are gaining popularity in the fitness landscape.

## 3. Sleep challenges and consistency

One of the most significant health challenges tracked by Whoop is sleep deficiency. Only about 22% of Whoop users get more than seven hours of sleep per night, meaning roughly 80% of users are sleep-deprived. Many people believe they're getting adequate sleep but discover they're actually getting much less once they start tracking.

Sleep consistency emerged as a crucial metric. Whoop found that maintaining similar bedtimes and wake times is vital for health. The company developed metrics around sleep consistency, efficiency, and stress, not just total hours. Research shows that maintaining consistent sleep patterns is linked to better circadian rhythm, overall body performance, and longevity. The concept of "social jet lag" describes how people maintain consistent sleep during weekdays but drastically change patterns on weekends.

## 4. Global sleep patterns and cultural differences

Sleep patterns vary significantly across different countries and cultures. The Middle East shows particularly unique sleep behaviors, with average bedtimes in cities like Riyadh and Doha being around 2:00 AM. This late bedtime might be attributed to cultural factors and the substitution of alcohol with stimulants like caffeine and nicotine.

Other interesting country-specific patterns emerged from Whoop's global data. Ireland reports the highest alcohol consumption rates. Australia and the US report the highest rates of sexual activity. Cold plunging is especially popular in Sweden, while saunas are favored in Finland. The UK has a stronger weightlifting culture compared to the US, where walking, running, and cycling are the top three activities.

## 5. The only child perspective

Will Ahmed reflected on being an only child and how it shaped his personality and entrepreneurial journey. He believes only children tend to be more self-centered with a stronger belief that they can get what they want in life. Growing up, he spent considerable time with adults, becoming comfortable in adult environments.

This upbringing helped Ahmed develop introspection skills crucial for entrepreneurship. As an only child, he became comfortable looking inward to determine what he wanted, rather than asking others for direction. He also received more parental attention, which helped build self-esteem and resilience in the face of rejection. These qualities proved valuable when starting Whoop at just 22 years old, helping him navigate the challenges of entrepreneurship.

## 6. Overcoming self-doubt in entrepreneurship

Ahmed discussed how he dealt with self-doubt while building Whoop. He separated his identity from his company's performance, recognizing that linking personal worth to business outcomes isn't productive. He realized that if he didn't grow as a leader, he would become a detriment to the company's growth.

Early in his entrepreneurial journey, Ahmed put up "real walls" to feedback between ages 22-25, being stubborn and certain about things. While this helped get the business off the ground, it made him difficult to work with. He gradually developed a process for questioning his convictions by examining them through others' perspectives. He believes some self-doubt is healthy, but confidence and self-belief are prerequisites for tackling difficult challenges.

## 7. Learning from success versus failure

Ahmed challenged the popular notion that people learn more from failure than success. He argued that while failure provides valuable lessons, successful ventures often contain unique "special sauce" elements that are more instructive. Most startups fail for similar common reasons, while successful companies each have unique qualities worth studying.

The conversation highlighted how closely success and failure can be related. Ahmed shared that Whoop nearly failed several times, almost running out of money six years into the company. Had the company failed then, he might have concluded he should have been less ambitious with technology or gone to market sooner. Ironically, the aspects that almost caused failure ultimately became reasons for the company's success when it finally took off.

## 8. The cost of elite performance

The conversation explored the hidden costs of elite performance across various fields. Ahmed has spent time with top athletes like Michael Phelps, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Patrick Mahomes, noting they share an unmistakable intense energy and drive that cannot be faked. This elite mentality often comes with significant sacrifices unseen by fans.

These sacrifices include being the first person at practice facilities daily, extensive recovery routines, time away from family, and other personal costs. The discussion extended to other high achievers like Elon Musk, who once said people wouldn't want to be him if they understood the mental "storm" he experiences. This raised an important question about what price people pay to become someone others admire, and whether admirers would want to pay that same price.

## 9. Discovering what you want in life

Ahmed offered insights on how to discover what you truly want in life. He emphasized that this process requires inward examination rather than seeking external opinions. Young people often struggle with this introspection because they haven't yet learned how to effectively communicate with themselves.

He suggested paying attention to fleeting thoughts that occur in quiet moments, like in the shower or when alone. These recurring thoughts often indicate what truly matters to you. Ahmed also recommended practices like meditation to develop the skill of looking inward. A key challenge is that many people are constantly distracted by smartphones, which prevents the boredom necessary for meaningful inner dialogue and self-discovery.

## 10. Getting what you want after discovering it

Once you know what you want, Ahmed emphasized several principles for achievement. First, state your desire clearly and openly to the world without being coy. Second, commit to consistent hard work, which serves as a major differentiator from others. This consistency creates opportunities that might be perceived as luck.

Another crucial element is developing comfort with rejection. The more ambitious your goals, the more rejection you'll face. Interestingly, Ahmed observed that most people aren't truly bothered by rejection itself but by the fear of rejection. This fear often leads people to become insular rather than outward-facing when pursuing goals. He recommends being introspective about what you want but extroverted in your pursuit of obtaining it.
