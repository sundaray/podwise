Here are the top 10 key takeaways from a fascinating conversation with Freya India about why modern women feel more lost than ever, exploring the profound impact of therapy culture, social media, and changing family dynamics on young women's mental health and relationships.

## 1. Therapy culture has replaced religion

Therapy culture has evolved into a modern substitute for religion among young women. They interpret their lives, relationships, and emotions through a therapeutic lens. This shift mirrors religious practices in new ways - positive affirmations have replaced prayers, healing journeys have replaced salvation, and reframing intrusive thoughts has replaced resisting temptation.

Young women, particularly those becoming less religious, have embraced this therapeutic worldview to fill the void left by declining religious participation. The appeal lies in how therapy culture provides comfort and order similar to religion but without imposing restrictions or behavioral standards. It offers a sense of belonging without demanding the personal sacrifices that traditional religious practice might require.

## 2. Pathologizing normal emotions

Modern therapy culture encourages young people to view ordinary emotions as medical conditions. Normal feelings like hurt, disappointment, and anxiety are now frequently labeled as trauma or attachment disorders. This medicalization of everyday emotions has created a culture where common emotional responses are treated as symptoms requiring diagnosis and treatment.

The language used has shifted dramatically. Young women increasingly discuss their experiences using clinical terminology rather than simple emotional language. Terms like "attachment styles," "trauma," and "red flags" have replaced traditional vocabulary for describing relationships and feelings. This shift in language fundamentally changes how young women perceive their emotional experiences and interpersonal relationships.

## 3. Therapy culture may be worse for women than men

While therapy culture was initially thought to be particularly harmful to men by imposing female approaches to problems, it may actually be more detrimental to women because it amplifies their natural tendency to ruminate. Women already have a predisposition toward overthinking and co-ruminating (dwelling on problems with friends). Therapy culture encourages them to delve deeper into their own thoughts and search for symptoms.

For young anxious girls, being advised to look inward for relief can worsen their condition rather than help it. The culture promotes excessive self-reflection and analysis, which can intensify anxiety and create a cycle of overthinking. This approach plays directly into existing tendencies, potentially exacerbating mental health challenges rather than alleviating them.

## 4. Therapy culture becomes a control mechanism

Young women use therapy language as a form of control when faced with uncomfortable emotions or situations. By categorizing and diagnosing feelings, they create an illusion of management over painful experiences. This resembles how some men use gym culture, testosterone, and self-optimization trends to gain a sense of control over their emotional lives.

This approach often leads to misattribution of problems. For instance, a woman might describe a partner's infidelity as triggering her "anxious attachment" rather than acknowledging a legitimate relationship problem. The therapeutic framing shifts focus from addressing actual issues to managing one's psychological response, which provides a sense of control but may prevent confronting real-world problems directly.

## 5. Excessive self-focus blocks real development

The hyper-focus on self-analysis can paradoxically prevent genuine growth. Constant introspection and attachment style analysis can lead to endless excuses for negative behaviors without prompting actual change. Many young women believe they're engaged in self-development when they're actually trapped in self-obsession.

This therapeutic mindset provides explanations for behavior without encouraging accountability. It creates an illusion of working on oneself while potentially reinforcing negative patterns. The constant analysis and "doing the work" mentality can become placeholders for genuine improvement, similar to how some people focus excessively on preparation and tools rather than taking meaningful action to address their issues.

## 6. Social media amplifies rumination

Social media platforms serve as rumination machines, particularly for young women who already tend to co-ruminate. Algorithms detect users' interests in certain psychological topics and feed them increasingly extreme content about disorders, symptoms, and problematic relationships. This creates a digital environment that amplifies existing tendencies toward overthinking.

Platforms like TikTok and Reddit forums encourage collective analysis of problems, which can worsen mental health. Content creators competing for attention often produce extreme, engaging videos featuring vague "red flags" or warning signs in relationships. When consumed regularly, this content creates an impression that any relationship can be toxic, making young women increasingly risk-averse and anxious about normal interpersonal dynamics.

## 7. Declining family structure leaves young people seeking guidance online

As family structures change and adults step back from giving direct guidance, young people turn to online sources for advice. Over 50% of children in the UK don't live with both parents by age 14, creating a vacuum of belonging and stability. Without close adults to provide relationship guidance, young women seek advice from online influencers and "experts" who don't know them personally.

This shift from personalized guidance to generic online advice removes context and intimate knowledge from the equation. Online experts are incentivized to create engaging, extreme content rather than nuanced advice tailored to individual circumstances. The result is young people applying standardized advice to unique situations without the moderating influence of adults who understand their specific needs and personalities.

## 8. Dependence is pathologized while independence is glamorized

Modern culture teaches young women that needing others is problematic while complete independence is ideal. This contradicts attachment research showing that healthy dependence actually fosters independence. The "dependency paradox" reveals that couples who are more interdependent become more capable of pursuing individual goals.

Young women receive mixed messages - therapy culture encourages emotional expression, while "strong independent woman" ideology suggests they should never care too much or depend on anyone. This creates confusion about normal human needs for connection. The narrative that a person must be completely healed, confident, and self-sufficient before entering relationships contradicts how humans naturally develop through relationships, not in isolation from them.

## 9. Young people lack protective boundaries yet are overcoddled

Modern parenting has created a paradoxical situation where young people are simultaneously overprotected in some areas while dangerously underprotected in others. Parents are overly involved in certain aspects of their children's lives but absent in crucial areas like digital safety and sexual boundaries. They may coddle their children physically while failing to establish meaningful rules and boundaries.

The rejection of traditional protective roles, particularly from fathers and male figures, has left young women vulnerable in new ways. In attempting to avoid being patronizing or patriarchal, society has eliminated beneficial forms of protection along with harmful ones. The result is young women who feel entitled to safety but lack the personal boundaries and social structures that previously provided it.

## 10. Commodification of self through social media

Young women are increasingly encouraged to view themselves as products or brands, particularly through social media and platforms like OnlyFans. The evolution of influencer culture has normalized the commodification of personal identity and appearance. What began with relatively wholesome content creators has gradually shifted toward more extreme self-objectification presented as empowerment.

Girls as young as 13 are reportedly using fake IDs to post explicit content online, seeing this as a path to status and financial success. The influencers they aspire to emulate present self-commodification as empowering rather than exploitative. This fundamentally changes how young women perceive their value and relationships, teaching them to seek validation through displaying themselves for public consumption rather than through personal growth and genuine connections.
