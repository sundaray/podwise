Here are the top 10 key takeaways from Dr. Nicole LePera's conversation with Jay Shetty about how our childhood experiences shape our relationship patterns and what we can do to heal them.

## 1. Subconscious patterns govern our relationships

Our relationship behaviors are largely governed by our subconscious mind, operating outside our awareness. These patterns include deeply held beliefs about ourselves, roles we've learned to play, and nervous system responses based on past experiences.

When we experience relationship triggers, we often react from these unconscious patterns rather than responding to the present moment. Our minds make automatic interpretations of events based on past experiences, connecting them to physiological shifts in our bodies. This creates what feels like instinctive reactions that we believe we can't control.

Developing awareness of these subconscious patterns is the first step toward creating space for change. By understanding what's happening beneath the surface—both in our thoughts and our bodies—we can begin to pause before habitual reactions, giving ourselves the opportunity to choose differently.

## 2. Childhood experiences shape our adult relationships

The experiences we had during childhood fundamentally impact how we relate to others as adults. Early relationships with caregivers create templates for how we define ourselves, process emotions, and connect with others.

These childhood patterns become the foundation for our relationship behaviors. Dr. LePera explains that many of our current relationship struggles stem from unmet needs, lack of emotional attunement, or adaptations we made to feel safe during childhood. For instance, if a parent expressed love through acts of service like keeping a clean house, we might interpret a partner's unwashed dishes as a sign they don't care about us.

The subtle ways our early experiences affect us can be surprising. Jay Shetty shared how he realized one of his caregivers had shown him love but made him feel guilty when he didn't reciprocate, a pattern he later found himself repeating in his adult relationships. Recognizing these connections allows us to understand our reactions are not random but tied to specific formative experiences.

## 3. Familiar patterns feel safe even when they're harmful

Our nervous systems prefer what's familiar, even when those patterns are unhealthy or chaotic. This explains why many people recreate relationship dynamics similar to those they experienced growing up, despite consciously wanting something different.

When we experience peace or stability in a relationship after being accustomed to chaos, our nervous systems might interpret this unfamiliar calm as threatening. This can lead us to unconsciously create drama or problems because the peaceful state feels more uncomfortable than the chaotic one we know how to navigate.

Breaking these patterns requires teaching our bodies how to recognize and become comfortable with healthier relationship dynamics. Dr. LePera emphasizes that familiarity simply means repetition and predictability—it doesn't necessarily indicate something positive or healthy. Understanding this distinction helps us question whether the relationship patterns that feel "right" to us are actually serving our wellbeing.

## 4. Communication bridges understanding gaps

Many relationship conflicts stem from projection and assumption rather than reality. We often attribute meanings to others' actions based on our own interpretations rather than understanding their true intentions.

Jay Shetty shared an example of his partner being quiet during car rides, which he interpreted as a sign something was wrong because in his childhood, silence meant danger. When he finally asked about it, he discovered she simply enjoyed looking out the window and listening to music. This simple communication prevented years of unnecessary worry.

Effective communication requires curiosity and openness rather than demands. Instead of saying "I wish you'd talk more in the car," a more productive approach is saying "Because of how I grew up, I associate quietness with something being wrong. What does it mean for you?" This creates a safe space to explore different perspectives without judgment.

## 5. Expectations cause suffering in relationships

Expecting others to change creates suffering when those expectations aren't met. Many relationship problems stem from the belief that we can change others' behavior through our own actions.

Dr. LePera suggests an empowering shift is accepting that others might not change and asking ourselves what we can do given that reality. When we give up expectations that others should behave differently, we reduce our suffering and gain clarity about our own choices.

This applies particularly to family relationships where dynamics have been reinforced over decades. Jay Shetty mentioned coaching someone who complained about a partner's trait they'd observed consistently for thirty years. Letting go of the expectation this would suddenly change after thirty years allows us to make peace with reality and focus on what we can control—our own responses and boundaries.

## 6. Nervous system regulation affects relationship quality

Our nervous system state fundamentally influences our capacity for healthy relationships. When we're in survival mode, we physically cannot access the parts of ourselves capable of empathy, consideration, and love.

Dr. LePera emphasizes that before we can create secure, loving relationships, we need to establish safety in our own bodies. This involves learning to self-regulate our nervous systems and find ways to co-regulate with trusted others.

Being grounded in our bodies allows us to connect with our emotions, hold space for others, and act from compassion rather than reactivity. Without this foundation, we remain stuck in protective patterns that prioritize survival over connection. Learning to recognize and shift our nervous system states becomes a crucial relationship skill.

## 7. Love requires both feeling and action

Love isn't just an emotion but also involves conscious action. Dr. LePera defines love as a feeling connected to actions that demonstrate care, consideration, and compassion for another person.

This understanding of love requires presence in our bodies and awareness of others. It's not just about being "hit over the head with a love spell" but about grounded moments where we extend space and awareness to another person's needs and perspectives.

When we're disconnected from our bodies or stuck in survival mode, we can't genuinely love because we can't consider perspectives outside our own. True love emerges from a state of safety where we're able to feel our emotions and deliberately choose to act in service of another's wellbeing.

## 8. Reconnecting with our bodies is essential for healing

Many people become disconnected from their bodies due to childhood experiences where physical sensations were misunderstood or invalidated. Jay Shetty shared how he experienced physical symptoms of anxiety as a child that doctors couldn't explain, leading him to disconnect from his body and live "cerebrally."

Dr. LePera described a similar experience of anxiety symptoms that led her to avoid physical exercise because increased heart rate triggered panic feelings. This disconnection from the body creates a barrier to emotional health since our emotions are physically experienced through bodily sensations.

Reconnecting with the body requires daily commitment and willingness to experience discomfort. Both speakers emphasized that simply having awareness of body disconnection isn't enough—we must practice deliberate reconnection through activities like meditation, gentle movement, and allowing ourselves to feel sensations without immediately trying to escape them.

## 9. Relationship conflicts often mask deeper unmet needs

Arguments about surface issues like household chores or schedules frequently disguise deeper emotional needs. Dr. LePera shared how her frustration about unwashed dishes wasn't actually about cleanliness but about feeling emotionally unseen.

These conflicts occur when we seek to meet childhood emotional needs through adult relationships. If we lacked emotional attunement as children, we might unconsciously look for it through specific actions from our partners, becoming upset when those actions don't occur even if our partners are showing care in other ways.

Understanding the real needs beneath our reactions allows us to communicate more effectively. Rather than demanding specific behaviors, we can express the underlying emotional need, opening possibilities for meeting that need in various ways rather than fixating on one specific manifestation.

## 10. Change requires both awareness and embodied action

Awareness alone doesn't create transformation. While recognizing patterns is important, real change comes from consistently making different choices even before we fully believe in them.

Dr. LePera explains that beliefs are repeated thoughts grounded in lived experience. We can't simply affirm new beliefs into existence—we must weaken old neural networks by withdrawing attention from unhelpful thoughts while simultaneously creating new experiences through different actions.

The process involves noticing when old beliefs arise, consciously redirecting attention, and then asking "How would someone who embodies my desired quality act in this situation?" By taking actions aligned with our desired beliefs before we fully feel them, we gradually create new neural networks that eventually become our new normal. This practice of "acting as if" creates embodied experiences that eventually shift both our feelings and beliefs.
