Here are the top 10 key takeaways from Jay Shetty's conversation with David Ko, CEO of Calm, about managing stress and mental well-being in our increasingly demanding world.

## 1. Your mind is like a battery

David Ko introduces a powerful metaphor that compares our mental health to a phone battery. This concept came from a friend who asked her children "how's your battery?" instead of "how are you?" and received more honest answers than the typical "fine."

This battery metaphor works because it's simple and relatable. Children and adults alike understand the concept of a device needing to be recharged. It creates a non-intimidating way to discuss mental health without triggering the stigma that sometimes comes with more clinical terminology.

## 2. Understanding your battery percentage

Ko breaks down the battery concept into four zones. When you're at 75-100%, you're doing well. At 50-75%, you might need to start thinking about recharging. If you're at 25-50%, it's definitely time to take a break, perhaps by taking a walk or putting down your phone.

When you find yourself at 0-25%, this is a critical indicator that something isn't right. This zone requires an immediate hard stop to figure out how to recharge effectively. Everyone has different techniques for recharging, and it's important to find what works for you personally.

## 3. Good stress versus bad stress

Not all stress is bad. Good stress can lead to resilience, growth, and a stronger culture. It's unrealistic to expect a completely stress-free work environment. There will always be deadlines and challenges to meet.

Bad stress, however, creates a vicious cycle. It leads to anxiety, depression, and eventually physical ailments due to the link between mental and physical health. The key is finding the right balance. Leaders need to recognize when they're creating good stress that motivates versus bad stress that breaks people down.

## 4. Taking intentional breaks

People often mistakenly believe their brain has endless capacity, but this simply isn't true. The brain, like everything else, needs to recharge. Finding ways to take breaks throughout the day is essential for maintaining productivity and mental health.

Ko mentions that when he works while his battery is below 25%, his work quality suffers significantly. No amount of artificial intelligence can fix work done with a depleted mental battery. Taking intentional breaks to recharge is not a luxury but a necessity for quality performance.

## 5. Creating space for real conversations

When asking someone "how are you doing?", we subconsciously hope for the simple answer "I'm good" so we can move on. Creating genuine space for real conversations requires intention and presence. It means being prepared for an honest answer like "I'm not doing well."

Leaders particularly struggle with this because they're expected to have all the answers and make various decisions. Being truly present for conversations means giving others your full attention. It means putting aside other thoughts and distractions to truly listen and engage with the person in front of you.

## 6. Vulnerability as strength

Many leaders avoid vulnerability because they fear being perceived as weak. There's still a cultural expectation that strength means putting up a facade of bravado and arrogance. This perception is shifting, but slowly.

True strength comes from showing both sides of yourself and being willing to open up. When leaders demonstrate vulnerability, they create permission for others to do the same. This opens up more authentic communication channels throughout the organization and leads to a stronger company culture.

## 7. Productivity is about quality, not quantity

Being involved in every decision doesn't make you productive. In fact, it often creates more stress and reduces overall productivity. True productivity isn't about the number of meetings or decisions but rather the quality of those decisions.

Quality decisions are those that meaningfully move the business forward. This might involve helping teams unlock a product decision or establishing partnerships. Being intentional about where you spend your time and which decisions you involve yourself in is crucial for effective leadership.

## 8. The power of presence

Being physically present but mentally elsewhere drains your battery faster. Many people drain their energy by trying to multitask or thinking about other things when they should be focused on the present moment. This divided attention depletes energy without accomplishing more.

When you're fully present with someone, you're not only charging them up but also recharging yourself. This mutual exchange of energy occurs through authentic conversation and genuine connection. It's a superpower that creates positive energy rather than depleting it.

## 9. Creating a culture of mental health awareness

While conversations about mental health are becoming more approachable in everyday life, they often stop at the workplace door. Leaders need to create environments where mental health can be discussed openly, just as it increasingly is in personal settings.

Simple practices like starting meetings with meditation or ending them with expressions of gratitude can transform company culture. Giving employees "Zoom-free days" and permission to decline meetings when needed shows that mental health is truly valued. These small but consistent actions establish mental well-being as part of the company's DNA.

## 10. Teaching mental health literacy early

Physical education is mandatory in schools, but mental health education often gets overlooked. Children need to develop vocabulary and understanding around their mental health from an early age, just as they learn about physical health.

Many adults struggle with mental health issues that began in childhood but weren't properly identified or addressed. Teaching children to recognize and articulate their feelings helps them develop healthier coping mechanisms. Early intervention and education could prevent many of the negative behaviors adults turn to when stressed, such as overeating, smoking, or excessive drinking.
