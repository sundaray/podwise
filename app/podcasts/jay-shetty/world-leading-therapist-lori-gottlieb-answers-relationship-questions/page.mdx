Here are the top 10 key takeaways from therapist Lori Gottlieb's conversation with Jay Shetty that will transform how you approach relationships and help you build deeper, more authentic connections.

## 1. Being single isn't being behind if you're doing the work

Being single at any age isn't a problem if you're actively doing the inner work needed for healthy relationships. This means examining what hasn't worked in past relationships and understanding your patterns. Many people compare themselves to others, especially on social media, creating anxiety about their relationship status.

People who are in relationships but haven't done this inner work are actually further behind than single people who have. They may be in relationships that aren't healthy or won't last. Lori emphasizes that doing the internal work makes you much closer to finding the right person than simply being in a relationship for the sake of it. The journey of self-discovery and growth prepares you for a healthier partnership.

## 2. We marry our unfinished business

We unconsciously seek out people who remind us of unresolved issues from our past, particularly from childhood. Even when we consciously want the opposite of what hurt us before, our unconscious mind is drawn to what feels familiar. This explains why people often find themselves in similar relationship patterns despite wanting something different.

When we haven't done the necessary inner work, we keep attracting people who mirror our unfinished business. For example, if someone grew up with a neglectful parent, they might unconsciously be drawn to partners who are emotionally unavailable, even though they consciously want someone attentive. The key to breaking this pattern is becoming aware of these unconscious attractions and doing the work to heal those past wounds, which eventually leads to being drawn to healthier partners.

## 3. Slowing down paradoxically saves time in relationships

There's often pressure to quickly decide if someone is "the one," especially as people get older. However, Lori suggests that slowing down actually saves time in the long run. By taking time to understand relationship dynamics and working through issues together, you avoid repeating the same mistakes with new partners.

Rushing to judgment about compatibility often leads to ending relationships that had potential or staying in unsuitable ones. The podcast shares an example of a woman who wanted to leave her relationship due to some issues but was advised to try couples therapy for six months. A year later, she was grateful she stayed and worked through her problems. Whether a relationship continues or ends, the growth that comes from doing the work together provides valuable insights that benefit future relationships.

## 4. First impressions aren't reliable indicators of relationship success

The idea that you should feel immediate chemistry or "know right away" when you meet "the one" isn't supported by research. A longitudinal study mentioned by Lori followed couples over 20 years, starting from their first date. It found that people who ended up in happy marriages often rewrote their first-date stories to match their current feelings, even when their initial impressions were merely "fine" with no special spark.

People put too much weight on first meetings and first dates, which are inherently performative situations where both people are nervous and trying to impress each other. Lori advises giving potential partners more than one chance if you had a good time and felt comfortable, even without butterflies. Sometimes attraction grows as you get to know someone's authentic self, which may not be fully visible in the artificial setting of a first date.

## 5. How you feel about yourself is a better dating metric than how you feel about them

After a first date, most people focus exclusively on what they thought about the other person. Lori suggests a paradigm shift: ask yourself how you felt about yourself in their presence instead. Did you feel comfortable, natural, and relaxed? Did you feel good about who you are when you were with them?

Feeling peaceful around someone rather than constantly nervous or performing is often a better indicator of compatibility than butterflies or excitement. When someone genuinely listens and shows interest in understanding you, it creates space for you to feel good about yourself. This is more valuable long-term than someone who merely entertains you or creates intense feelings initially but doesn't help you feel comfortable in your own skin.

## 6. Love is a verb, not just a feeling

Love isn't just an airy emotion or chemical reaction; it's demonstrated through actions. The feeling of infatuation—which produces dopamine reactions similar to drugs—can cloud judgment. Real love is expressed through how we treat others daily and how we show understanding.

Lori shares a powerful example of a woman who told her husband that rather than hearing "I love you," she wanted to hear "I understand you." True connection comes from making the effort to understand your partner's "operating instructions"—their unique needs, triggers, and communication style. Love as a verb means consistently taking action to understand and honor these differences, not just feeling or professing love.

## 7. Communication about desires doesn't diminish the magic

Many people avoid directly stating their wants and needs because they believe their partner "should just know" if they truly love them. This mindset creates disappointment and resentment. Contrary to common belief, clearly expressing desires doesn't diminish the magic of a relationship—it enhances it.

Lori gives the example of birthdays, where one person might say "it's no big deal" while secretly hoping for a celebration. When their partner takes them at their word and plans something simple, they feel misunderstood and disappointed. By directly communicating preferences, both partners can feel successful and connected. The real magic isn't in mind-reading but in creating joy for each other through clear, honest communication about desires.

## 8. Address issues early when the "cement is still wet"

Relationship patterns solidify over time like drying cement. Early in relationships, people often ignore behaviors that bother them, trying to be accommodating or fearing they'll appear too demanding. When these issues finally surface months or years later, they're much harder to address because patterns have solidified.

Bringing up concerns when the "cement is still wet" allows for easier adjustments and reveals important information about compatibility. If someone responds positively to feedback early on, it's a good sign. If they can't accommodate reasonable requests when patterns are still forming, that's valuable information too. Addressing issues early prevents resentment from building and gives the relationship a stronger foundation from the beginning.

## 9. "Boundary" is something you set with yourself, not others

The term "boundary" is often misused in popular psychology. A boundary isn't a rule you force others to follow; it's a standard you set for yourself about what you will accept and how you'll respond if that standard isn't met. Others may or may not respect your boundaries, but you always have control over your response.

Lori gives an example of setting a boundary with a mother who consistently asks invasive questions about one's dating life. Instead of expecting the mother to change, the boundary involves clearly stating that if she asks such questions, you will end the visit. The key is consistently enforcing this boundary yourself, leaving when the line is crossed. This approach shifts focus from trying to control others' behavior to taking responsibility for your own responses and consistently honoring the standards you've set.

## 10. Rupture and repair are normal and necessary

Every relationship experiences ruptures—disagreements, misunderstandings, or hurt feelings. What matters isn't avoiding these ruptures but how couples repair them. The ability to address conflicts, take responsibility, apologize, and find solutions together is a crucial indicator of long-term compatibility.

If you've been dating for six months without any significant disagreements, Lori suggests you probably aren't going deep enough or being authentic with each other. Future-tripping (imagining an ideal future together) isn't as useful as observing how you navigate challenges in the present. How you handle ruptures now—with blame and defensiveness or with accountability and repair—is exactly how you'll handle them in the future. This pattern of rupture and repair is the single best predictor of what your relationship will look like long-term.
