Here are the top 10 key takeaways from Jay Shetty's fascinating conversation with Kai Dickens about the extraordinary telepathic abilities of non-speaking individuals.

## 1. Telepathy in non-speaking individuals with autism

Ky Dickens has spent over three years investigating claims of telepathy among non-speaking individuals with autism. These individuals, who often have apraxia (a mind-body disconnect), demonstrate an ability to read the thoughts of those around them, particularly their parents and teachers. Their abilities are demonstrated through spelling to communicate, using letter boards to point to letters as a form of expression.

The abilities go beyond simple mind-reading. Ky describes witnessing tests where non-speaking individuals could consistently identify what their parents were shown on flash cards with near-perfect accuracy. These demonstrations were repeatable and observed in multiple families across different locations, suggesting this phenomenon is widespread among non-speaking individuals with apraxia.

## 2. The distinction between autism and apraxia

Ky emphasizes that the telepathic abilities aren't specifically tied to autism but rather to apraxia—a condition where there's a disconnect between mind and body. Many non-speaking individuals diagnosed with autism may actually be experiencing apraxia as their primary condition. This distinction is important because it challenges current diagnostic frameworks.

Parents and teachers working with these individuals often come to realize that the issue isn't cognitive ability but rather the physical inability to speak or control their bodies reliably. Ky suggests that our diagnostic tools might be inadequate, lumping many conditions under the "autism" umbrella when more specific diagnoses would be more accurate and helpful. This reframing shifts the conversation from disability to different ability.

## 3. Expanding beyond telepathy to other unexplained abilities

What began as an investigation into telepathy revealed a spectrum of unexplained abilities. Non-speaking individuals demonstrated knowledge of languages they'd never been taught, accurate predictions of future events, and awareness of information they couldn't have learned through conventional means. Some could see auras around people, plants, and even rocks.

Many non-speaking individuals also reported connections with deceased relatives, delivering specific messages that they couldn't have known through normal means. The scope of these abilities suggests something far beyond simple mind-reading. Ky describes it as a "bouquet" of spiritual gifts that non-speaking individuals with apraxia seem particularly able to access due to their unique neurological configuration.

## 4. Scientific resistance to studying psi phenomena

Dr. Diane Hennacy Powell, a Harvard-educated neuroscientist studying these telepathic claims, faced significant professional backlash. Despite her credentials and methodical approach, scientific institutions rooted in materialist philosophy made it difficult for her to publish papers, secure research grants, or advance her work. She even temporarily lost her medical license and had to undergo psychological testing.

This resistance illustrates how deeply entrenched materialist thinking is in scientific institutions. Ky notes that science should be based on freedom of inquiry—the ability to ask questions and follow evidence wherever it leads. The consequences for researchers who venture into these territories can be severe, limiting our collective understanding of consciousness and human potential.

## 5. The role of love and belief in facilitating telepathic connection

Ky repeatedly emphasizes that love seems to be the foundation for these telepathic connections. Parents who continue to love and communicate with their children despite receiving little verbal or physical feedback create the conditions for these abilities to emerge. The deepest connections appear to form in relationships characterized by unconditional love and acceptance.

Additionally, belief appears to play a role in witnessing these phenomena. Ky notes that approaching the experience with skepticism may prevent people from seeing the abilities in action. This mirrors the placebo effect in medical science, where belief itself can create measurable physiological changes. The non-speaking individuals seem more likely to demonstrate their abilities in environments where they feel trusted and accepted.

## 6. Consciousness as a fundamental aspect of reality

The podcast discusses a radical reframing of consciousness—not as an emergent property that arises from brain activity, but as a fundamental aspect of reality that precedes physical existence. This inverts the traditional scientific model where consciousness sits at the "tippy top" of a pyramid of physical processes. Instead, it suggests consciousness is the foundation upon which physical reality is built.

This perspective aligns with certain Eastern philosophical traditions that view consciousness as primary rather than secondary. If consciousness is fundamental, then phenomena like telepathy, precognition, and other psi abilities become more comprehensible. They represent different ways of accessing a shared field of consciousness rather than supernatural or impossible occurrences.

## 7. Historical precedents for scientific resistance to new ideas

Ky points out that revolutionary ideas often face initial ridicule and resistance before eventually becoming accepted as self-evident. She references several historical examples: Mendel's genetic theory was initially dismissed, the Earth was long believed to be flat, and the Wright brothers' flying machine was disbelieved until widely demonstrated. This pattern suggests our current resistance to psi phenomena may follow a similar trajectory.

Scientific paradigm shifts are often uncomfortable and met with institutional resistance. Ky suggests that clinging to strict materialism may eventually look as outdated as believing in a flat Earth. The evidence for telepathy and other psi abilities may eventually reach a tipping point where it becomes impossible to ignore, forcing a reevaluation of our fundamental understanding of consciousness and reality.

## 8. Two-way telepathic communication developing in teachers

One of the most surprising discoveries was that teachers working closely with non-speaking individuals sometimes began developing their own telepathic abilities. After extended periods of interaction, they reported being able to hear the thoughts of their students without requiring the spelling board. This created a two-way telepathic channel that made education more efficient.

This finding suggests that telepathic abilities might be latent in all humans but typically dormant. Close association with individuals who actively use these abilities appears to activate or "turn on" similar capacities in others. These teachers described the experience as hearing complete sentences in their minds, knowing exactly what their students were thinking without any physical communication. The consistency of these reports from teachers who had no contact with each other lends credibility to the phenomenon.

## 9. Government research into remote viewing and psi abilities

Ky discusses declassified CIA programs from the 1970s and 1980s called Project Grill Flame and Project Stargate, which investigated remote viewing—the ability to see distant locations without physical presence. These programs demonstrated statistically significant results, including the ability to accurately describe remote locations identified only by longitude and latitude coordinates.

The effectiveness of these programs was so compelling that they continued for years, with remote viewers even maintaining their abilities while in submarines deep underwater where normal signal transmission is impossible. Ky suggests that these government programs provide credible, documented evidence for psi abilities outside the context of autism. She believes similar research likely continues today in various countries.

## 10. Implications for how we view human potential

The podcast suggests these phenomena may represent not anomalies but untapped human potential. If non-speaking individuals can access these abilities, they may be latent in all humans. Ky describes how spending time with these individuals changed her own thought patterns, leading her to empty her mind and live more in the present moment.

One non-speaker posed the question: why do we try to measure telepathy in a lab but not try to measure love, which causes people to perform seemingly impossible feats like lifting cars in emergencies? This question challenges our hierarchy of what's worth scientific investigation. Ultimately, the research suggests humans may have far greater potential for connection and communication than our current paradigms recognize. As one non-speaker told Ky, "kindness is the best way to evolve," suggesting that developing these abilities may require not just scientific investigation but spiritual and ethical development.
