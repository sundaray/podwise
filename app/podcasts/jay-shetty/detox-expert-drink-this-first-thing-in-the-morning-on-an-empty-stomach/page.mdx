Here are the top 10 key takeaways from Jay Shetty's insightful conversation with nutritionist Elissa Goodman that could transform your approach to health and healing.

## 1. Subconscious patterns shape our health

Our subconscious mind significantly influences our health outcomes. During the first seven years of life, our subconscious is fully programmed, and we operate 95% from our subconscious and only 5% from our conscious mind. This programming affects how we perceive ourselves and can manifest in physical conditions.

Elissa shared her personal experience of being labeled a "sick kid" by her mother, which created a pattern of illness that followed her into adulthood. Many health issues stem from these early subconscious patterns that continue to repeat throughout life. Recognizing and reprogramming these patterns through practices like journaling, meditation, and sometimes even plant medicine can help break negative cycles and create new, healthier ones.

## 2. Hydration is a cornerstone of health

Dehydration is described as an "epidemic" that affects numerous bodily functions. When dehydrated, nothing in the body works properly - from adrenal function to brain activity and digestion. Many people mistakenly interpret thirst signals as hunger.

Goodman reveals that many of her clients experience significant health improvements simply by drinking two cups of water (16 ounces) before having coffee or tea in the morning. Celery juice has gained popularity partly because it's highly hydrating and mineral-rich. Proper hydration supports the central nervous system, helps manage stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, and improves digestive function. Starting the day with hydration sets a foundation for better overall health.

## 3. Cleansing is about nourishment, not deprivation

Contrary to popular belief, effective cleansing isn't about starvation or extreme deprivation. Goodman created a cleanse program that focuses on feeding and nourishing the body rather than restricting it. Her approach involves consuming anti-inflammatory foods and introducing a wide variety of vegetables - up to 50 different types in five days.

The purpose of cleansing is to reset the body and address issues caused by processed foods, bad seed oils, and chemicals in the modern diet. A well-designed cleanse provides the microbiome with necessary prebiotics and probiotics while giving cells what they need to function optimally. Plant-based foods are emphasized because they absorb quickly into the system and provide energy faster than animal proteins, which take longer to digest.

## 4. Self-love is fundamental to healing

Both Jay Shetty and Elissa Goodman emphasized that loving yourself is essential for genuine healing. When working with cancer patients, one of the first questions Goodman asks is whether they love themselves. This question often surprises clients because no one has asked them that before.

Self-compassion creates the foundation for making positive health choices. Without self-love, people tend to make decisions from a place of fear or punishment rather than nourishment and care. The healing journey becomes more effective when approached with self-acceptance and genuine care for one's wellbeing. This mindset shift can be transformative, allowing people to believe in their capacity to heal rather than seeing themselves as permanently damaged or limited.

## 5. Digestive health indicators and proper function

Healthy digestion is reflected in regular bowel movements. Goodman explains that going once daily is good, twice is great, and three times is perfect. Many people suffer from digestive issues due to insufficient fiber, inadequate hydration, chronic stress, and overconsumption of animal protein.

Animal protein takes approximately 14 hours to move through the small intestine, compared to just 90 minutes for plant-based foods. This slow transit time can contribute to digestive discomfort and irregularity. Stress significantly impacts digestion by shutting down the digestive system. Sleep quality also affects digestive function, as sleep is detoxifying and restorative for the digestive system. Proper digestive health serves as a barometer for overall wellness.

## 6. Plant-based foods process faster than animal proteins

The digestion time difference between plant and animal foods is striking. Plant-based foods take about 90 minutes to process through the small intestine, while animal proteins (like beef) require approximately 14 hours. This difference has significant implications for energy levels and digestive comfort.

Plant-based foods provide quicker energy because they're absorbed more rapidly into the system. This makes them excellent choices for times when immediate energy is needed. The longer digestion time for animal proteins means they stay in the digestive tract longer, which can be taxing on the system if consumed in large quantities or too frequently. Balancing both types of foods and being mindful of portion sizes (especially with animal proteins) can help optimize digestion and energy levels throughout the day.

## 7. Juicing delivers concentrated nutrition

Juicing provides a concentrated source of nutrients and makes it easier to consume larger quantities of vegetables. While some critics argue that juicing removes fiber, Goodman addresses this by using a blender to retain fiber while still getting the benefits of consuming multiple servings of vegetables quickly.

She recommends simple combinations like cucumber, celery, lemon, ginger, and spinach. Each ingredient serves a specific purpose: celery provides minerals and cleanses the gut and liver; cucumber hydrates and cleanses the kidneys; spinach offers iron; ginger provides antibacterial properties. Cold-pressed juices preserve more nutrients than heat-processed ones. For those who find it challenging to consume 8-10 cups of vegetables daily, juicing or blending can help reach this goal more easily.

## 8. Blood work reveals hidden health issues

Regular comprehensive blood work is crucial for catching health issues before they manifest as serious conditions. Goodman now performs thorough blood work with all clients, including tests for heavy metals, metabolic function, thyroid health, and hormones, regardless of age.

These tests often reveal concerning patterns that wouldn't otherwise be detected: elevated blood sugar (not yet pre-diabetic but trending that way), thyroid dysfunction, high insulin levels, elevated cortisol, and heavy metal toxicity. By identifying these issues early, interventions can be implemented before they develop into clinical conditions. This preventative approach allows for targeted strategies to address specific biochemical imbalances rather than waiting for symptoms to become severe enough to notice.

## 9. Overly restrictive approaches cause stress and failure

Being too rigid or perfectionistic about health can create counterproductive stress. Many people become overwhelmed by the plethora of health information and supplements available, leading them to either give up entirely or develop unhealthy anxiety around food and wellness practices.

Goodman advocates for simplicity - going back to basics with real food, proper hydration, adequate sleep, and just a few essential supplements rather than trying to do everything at once. She recommends taking one step at a time: perhaps focusing on hydration the first week, then gradually adding more plant-based foods, then improving sleep habits. This gradual approach prevents overwhelm and increases the likelihood of sustainable change. The goal should be progress rather than perfection.

## 10. Plant medicine can help rewire the subconscious

Plant medicine experiences, such as guided psilocybin sessions, can help access and rewire deep subconscious patterns that affect health. Goodman described her experience with plant medicine as transformative for breaking free from thought patterns that had been with her since childhood.

During her session with a shaman, she was able to identify and release fears and perfectionism that had contributed to her health issues. The experience allowed her to access a deeper sense of calm and self-love that conventional therapy hadn't fully provided. Importantly, she notes that the benefits weren't temporary - the positive changes remained after the session, though maintaining them still requires practices like meditation, journaling, and reflecting on gratitude. This suggests that for some people, plant medicine can create breakthroughs in cases where traditional approaches have stalled.
