Here are the top 10 insights from Jay Shetty's conversation with Alexis Ren and Ali Michelle about personal growth, feminine energy, and authentic relationships.

## 1. Honoring your feminine energy in a masculine world

Many women struggle with recognizing and embracing their femininity in a masculine-dominant culture. In America especially, there's a strong emphasis on "building your empire" and pushing forward with masculine energy. This creates exhaustion when women feel they must constantly push down doors with masculine force.

The feminine energy is naturally designed to attract, while masculine energy makes things happen. Both energies are necessary, but many women spin out trying to maintain constant masculine energy. This leads to burnout and questioning if they're truly living their dream life. Understanding and honoring your feminine energy involves breaking down limiting beliefs and recognizing when to flow rather than force.

## 2. Allowing relationships to evolve naturally

One of the most powerful aspects of deep friendships is allowing them to be fluid rather than fixed. Alexis and Ali describe how they've never held each other to a specific version of their relationship or judged each other for their choices. Instead, they've allowed their connection to evolve naturally over time.

This approach creates space for growth without resentment. They describe it as "dancing on the ashes of who we once were" and never holding each other to an idea of who they're supposed to be. This fluidity enables authentic growth because there's no box or expectation limiting the other person. When we hold someone to a fixed idea of who they should be, they may resent it because they're trying to evolve beyond that limitation.

## 3. Understanding the power of archetypes

Alexis and Ali discuss using archetypes as a framework for understanding themselves and others. They reference Carol Pearson's book "Awaken the Heroes Within," which explores twelve major archetypes within our subconscious. This approach creates more compassion and understanding than clinging to a single identity.

Using archetypes allows you to recognize which aspects of your subconscious you're currently wielding. Rather than being limited to one fixed identity, you can see yourself as expressing different archetypes at different times. This perspective helps name your shadow aspects more clearly and creates more compassion for yourself and others. It also enables you to see where you need more balance by identifying which archetypes need more development.

## 4. Breaking free from the porcelain suit

Many women feel trapped in what Ali describes as a "porcelain suit" - a perfect, unblemished exterior that limits authentic expression. This is particularly evident around beauty standards, which have historically provided security for women but can become a prison of perfectionism.

Ali shared an anecdote about a female singer who couldn't fully express her voice until she was encouraged to "make an ugly face" - breaking out of the porcelain exterior to access her true power. This represents the permission many women need to step beyond perfection and access their authentic power. Breaking free from this porcelain suit allows for genuine expression of quirks, imperfections, and the full range of human experience.

## 5. Addressing triggers with self-compassion

Alexis shared a powerful technique for addressing emotional triggers in real time. When triggered, she immediately asks herself why she's feeling triggered and connects with the childhood experiences that created that sensitivity. This prevents the trigger from becoming stored in the body as tension or future reactivity.

This process involves quickly identifying the trigger, connecting it to past experiences, and offering self-compassion. For example, when triggered by a flat tire situation, she realized it connected to childhood experiences where small problems caused massive family stress. By acknowledging this connection and offering herself compassion, the trigger dissolved immediately rather than becoming stored as tension in her body.

## 6. The freedom of embracing imperfection

Both guests emphasized how freeing it is to break away from trying to be profound or perfect all the time. They discussed how this quest for perfection often prevents authentic expression and connection. For creative people especially, the pressure to always be "on" can stifle genuine creativity.

Jay shared how during his tour, he intentionally moved away from a "holier than thou" teacher persona to just be himself - making jokes and being real. Ali described how her poetry mentor once forced her to scream a poem and jump around while being hit with a pillow to break her out of trying to sound perfect and access raw honesty. This freedom from perfection allows for flow states, genuine connection, and more authentic expression.

## 7. Redefining successful relationships

The traditional definition of a successful relationship is one that lasts forever. Alexis and Ali challenge this view, suggesting that growth is a better measure of success than time. A relationship can be considered successful if both people grow through it, regardless of how long it lasts.

This perspective removes the pressure of permanence and focuses instead on honesty and authentic connection. It also creates space for relationships to naturally evolve into different forms over time. The guests emphasized acting from love regardless of the relationship's future, maintaining integrity even through endings. This approach replaces the binary "success or failure" model with one that honors the journey and growth that occurs.

## 8. Balancing masculine and feminine energies within yourself

Rather than seeing masculine and feminine energies as separate or opposing forces, the guests discuss how everyone contains both energies and needs both to thrive. Recognizing your natural tendencies allows you to consciously cultivate balance. For example, Alexis noticed she naturally falls into masculine energy (action, driving forward) and balances this by deliberately practicing feminine activities like ballet or yoga.

The key is first understanding which energy dominates your natural reactions, then intentionally bringing in the complementary energy. This isn't about rejecting your dominant energy but appreciating how it has served you while creating space for balance. Both energies serve important purposes - masculine energy helps accomplish goals and create structure, while feminine energy allows for flow, intuition, and receptivity.

## 9. Non-envy as the foundation of lasting friendship

One of the most insightful observations was about envy's destructive role in relationships. Jay referenced Oprah's comment that her friendship with Gayle King has lasted because Gayle is one of the few people who's not been envious of her. The guests agreed that their friendship thrives because they actively support each other's success rather than competing.

This non-envious foundation comes from understanding your place and pace of growth. When you understand that you have your own unique path and timeline, you don't need to compete with others or feel threatened by their success. Instead, you can genuinely celebrate their achievements and help them grow. Alexis described herself as a "genie" who makes her friends' dreams her own, fighting for their success as passionately as for her own.

## 10. Honoring past survival mechanisms instead of rejecting them

A powerful insight came around how we often reject or feel ashamed of past coping mechanisms once they no longer serve us. Instead of viewing these as failures or wasted time, the guests suggest honoring how these patterns helped us survive. These mechanisms developed for important reasons and deserve gratitude even as we evolve beyond them.

This approach replaces shame with appreciation. Rather than thinking "I wasted years being this way," you recognize "this way of being helped me survive until I was ready for something more." Alexis emphasized the importance of recognizing that our bodies and hearts are intelligent and we lean into what we need to survive. As she put it: "It's time not just to survive anymore but to truly get into thriving."
