Here are the top 10 insights from Arthur Brooks on the "Daily Stoic" podcast that could revolutionize how you approach happiness and fulfillment.

## 1. Embrace suffering as sacred

Suffering is incredibly sacred, but you can't see that until you understand how the Stoics actually conceived of this and wrote about it really eloquently. You must suffer and you must embrace that suffering in a very positive way. It's not like, okay, I'm going to put up with this. Happiness has these parts, enjoyment, which is not pleasure. Satisfaction, which comes from managing your wants, not maximizing your halves. Meaning, which actually requires a lot of suffering and pain and sacrifice or you're not going to actually find this meaning.

The route to happiness goes through unhappiness. Suffering is incredibly sacred, but you can't see that until you understand how the stoics actually conceived of this and wrote about it really eloquently. You must suffer and you must embrace that suffering in a very positive way. I don't know what this day is going to bring. I'm going to be grateful for all the dessert I get to eat, but man, there's going to be things I don't like and I'm grateful for that too in advance.

## 2. Win the morning to win the day

The ignition of your day is then the day is yours. It really hurts, man. It's never been not painful for me at 4:45 in the morning because that's not what I want. I work out real hard for an hour and almost every morning. So I missed 11 days in 2023 in the gym. Because it's so important. Arthur Brooks describes waking at 4:45 AM, working out hard, and doing spiritual work before beginning his actual work around 7:30 AM when he'll get "three uninterrupted, max dopamine hours of focus and creativity."

You wake up, let's say you work out or you spend time talking to your spouse or you wrestle with your kids and then maybe you do a little work, whatever, you didn't get sucked into email, you got some stuff done early, right? Let's say you just do that in the morning and then you're driving to something, you get in the car, it's 10:00 a.m., you get a flat tire and you spend the next 5 hours by the side of the road waiting for someone to come pick you up or whatever. You're like cool because you already won. This is the reason that McCraven here at UT Austin gave that he was here like two weeks ago. Famous speech, make your bed. His whole point was get your first win.

## 3. Choose the divine path over animal instincts

The animal path and the divine path diverge around the decisions that we make as human beings. So one of the things that we know is that the evolutionary imperative is for you to be as comfortable as possible and husband your strength. So it's normal that mother nature says stay under the covers. That's the point about actually having a really developed prefrontal cortex, which is 30% of the weight of the human brain is that you can actually choose the divine, the uniquely human path over the animal pressures that you're actually getting.

The animal pressure say get as many calories and as many mates and as much rest as possible. And that's wrong. That's actually just wrong. Mother Nature doesn't want you to have the happiest life. Mother Nature wants you to live another day and have some babies. That's all mother nature wants. What Marcus Aurelius is talking about as was Epictetus and Seneca and everybody else in between is that there's a divinity to that rejection. There's a divinity to that sort of muscular attitude towards your own life. That there's something about it that goes beyond the animal nature of it.

## 4. Make the hard choice daily

To confront that, like I get it it hurts and that's the point. You know, that becomes part of the point of the exercise is the internal struggle that you face every single day. You can't face the struggle of life until you've faced the struggle with you. First thing in the morning and that very first moment when the alarm clock goes off, it's like, who's going to win? Brooks references "the choice of Hercules" - a founding myth where Hercules must choose between virtue and vice, the hard way and the easy way.

To choose the harder path because it's the harder path. That's an incredibly empowering victory that each one of us can have. And it starts with this tiny little choice. And why? Because all choices start with tiny choices. It's a branching design. This leads to this, leads to this, leads to this. Start someplace is the bottom line. And that as soon as that clock goes off, that's the first one.

## 5. Find meaning beyond positive thinking

So much of the misguided work that we've had in happiness is just positivity. You know, just positive thinking. That's the wrong way of thinking about it. According to Brooks, true happiness is more complex than mere positive thinking. It consists of enjoyment (which differs from pleasure), satisfaction (managing wants rather than maximizing possessions), and meaning (which requires suffering and sacrifice).

It's not like, okay, I'm going to put up with this. No, I don't know what this day is going to bring. I'm going to be grateful for all the dessert I get to eat, but man, there's going to be things I don't like and I'm grateful for that too in advance. Life has suffering in it. And so the whole point is not don't go searching for pleasure as your modus operandi. And don't try to get rid of your suffering, you need to be fully alive. St. Irenaeus, the great fourth century saint, the glory of God is a man fully alive. A person fully alive is a person who's like Teddy Roosevelt would say the man in the arena.

## 6. Create ideal days with space between activities

The ideal day has three things in it. The ideal day has a thing and then you also know yourself to know to protect the part of the day when you actually need to be thinking and writing and doing creative work. And then only parts of the day that you can schedule up where they make sense and you have tons of time between them. And so I'll tell people to just make three or four commitments and then have days that never have nothing, right? They'll have two or three things in it.

And then you'll be able to make them last as long as you want them to make and you're always going to start filling in things from there. But you have to build your schedule that way. My assistant, I've told her like no more than three things in the calendar in a day and ideally some days with nothing. And it's not that I'm not working. It's not that I'm not working. It's that I haven't scheduled any interruptions or random commitments or obligations. And so those are the best work days.

## 7. Balance business with discretionary time

So there's a sweet spot of business when it comes to happiness. If you're too idle, it's a huge problem. If you're too busy. Now, what we find is looking at the data on idleness and business, the optimal number of discretionary hours in the average work day is 9.5. The average number of discretionary hours a person gets is 1.8. There's a significant gap between the optimal amount of discretionary time people need (9.5 hours) and what they typically get (1.8 hours).

The reason it turns out that they get 1.8 when they need 9.5 is because they're more afraid of idleness than they are of business because idleness is more miserable than business. And so they overcorrect and make a mistake in the wrong direction. When you're idle, you immediately default go into the default mode network of the brain, the brain apparatus that makes you go ruminate and, you know, perseverate and think about your teenage kids and bad stuff. And it's no fun. It's really miserable.

## 8. Know when and how your brain works best

If you're a creator like you or me or writers, fundamentally we're idea dudes. It's we're not working in steel. You have to understand how your brain chemistry is optimized for ideas. That's a super important thing. Tony Morrison said, you have to know when you are at your best. Like when she's like, when do you make contact with the muses is what she was saying as a creative. And you have to know when that is.

And her thing was she liked to watch the sun come up while she wrote and she had to do it before she heard the word mom. And so it's getting up very early. So I go to mass or I say my prayers or whatever. A lot of people meditate. And then you can actually be then then use your caffeine. Don't use caffeine too early to wake up. The whole point is you don't want to block the inhibitory neuromodulators in your brain because then they'll be looking for a parking space. And then when you metabolize the caffeine, it'll all go in at 2:00 or 3:00 in the afternoon and you'll crash.

## 9. Move from "me self" to "I self"

When it was about you. Everything changed. So you step back and the I I don't recall seeing I in your columns very much. I went from the me self to the I self. So the I self is outwardly focused. The me self is looking in the mirror. The me self is really dangerous and what the world tells us to do and it's mediated by, you know, Instagram or something, which is the ultimate mirror.

Life became for me a pilgrimage. There's a Zen Buddhist coan of a junior monk who's walking down a trail in the woods and he sees a senior monk walking toward him. And he greets the senior monk and says, where are you going? And the senior monk says, I'm going on a pilgrimage. And the junior monk says, oh, where's your pilgrimage taking you? And he says, senior monk says, I don't know. Junior monk says, how do you not know where your pilgrimage is taking you? Why don't you know? The senior monk says, because not knowing is the most intimate knowledge.

## 10. Pursue intention without attachment

Intention without attachment. You have to go in a particular direction. There's a great word in Spanish, rumbo. And rumbo is a navigation term. It means the word in English is rum line. It's a sailing term. It means you got to go in a particular direction towards something and you can't move effectively or efficiently unless you have a straight line toward that thing.

But you must not be attached to the rum line, right? Because you're going to be blown off course and if you're dramatic and if you're only thinking about that, you'll fall prey to all kinds of psychological problems like the arrival fallacy. It's going to be so great when I'm number one. And that is the whole idea of in Buddhism of intention without attachment. Intention without attachment. That's what a pilgrimage really is. The pilgrimage is the intention. The lack of dogmatic need to get to a certain goal thinking that it's going to be so particularly wonderful is the non-attachment to that particular goal.
