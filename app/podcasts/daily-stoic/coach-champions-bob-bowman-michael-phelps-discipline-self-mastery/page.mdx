Here are the top 10 key takeaways from Bob Bowman's conversation about coaching Olympic champions, developing mental toughness, and the pursuit of excellence.

## 1. Do your work

Bob Bowman developed the mantra "Do your work" during a training camp at Colorado Springs. It began when he was feeling tired and unmotivated to go to the weight room. His assistant simply said, "I'm just going to do my work," which motivated Bowman to join him. This simple phrase became a powerful team philosophy.

The mantra emphasizes that success comes from consistent, sometimes mundanely boring daily effort. It reminds athletes that regardless of how they feel—whether they're at their best or worst—the answer is always the same: do your work. This philosophy acknowledges that incremental, consistent deposits in your "account" are what ultimately lead to significant changes and achievements.

## 2. The mentor's dilemma

Coaches face a challenging balancing act when working with today's young athletes. They need to maintain high standards while providing the right kind of support. Many young people interpret criticism as a judgment of their worth rather than feedback for improvement.

The effective approach involves framing high expectations positively. Bowman explains that saying something like "I have very high standards here, but I know you can meet them" communicates belief in the athlete's potential. This method encourages athletes to reach beyond their current capabilities without undermining their confidence, creating an environment where growth naturally occurs.

## 3. Surviving success is harder than achieving it

Achieving major success can be destabilizing because it doesn't deliver what many expect it will. After Michael Phelps' historic performance in Beijing, both Phelps and Bowman struggled with the question, "What do we do now?" The buildup to achievement often creates a clear path, but afterward, that structure disappears.

Success doesn't solve all problems as many athletes believe it will. Bills still need paying, personal challenges remain, and the motivation that drove the achievement may suddenly evaporate. The real challenge becomes finding new sources of motivation and purpose beyond the original goal. This requires developing a healthy perspective about achievement and learning to find fulfillment in the process rather than only in outcomes.

## 4. Focus on mastery, not external validation

Shifting the focus from external results to mastery creates a more sustainable approach to performance. Rather than chasing medals or recognition, the question becomes: "How good can you be at this? How far can you take this event?"

This approach puts athletes in control of their journey. External results largely depend on what other people do, which is uncontrollable. By concentrating on developing skills and understanding their craft, athletes build resilience against disappointment. This mindset also allows for continued growth and satisfaction throughout a career, even when competitive results fluctuate.

## 5. The power of having no opinion

Inspired by Stoic philosophy, Bowman practices the discipline of not forming or expressing opinions on everything. This approach, which he acknowledges "drives people I work with absolutely insane," gives him freedom from unnecessary mental and emotional burdens.

As people mature, they typically become less judgmental and more accepting of differences. This "live and let live" mentality allows coaches and athletes to focus energy on what truly matters. By reserving judgment for the few areas that genuinely require it, opinions carry more weight when expressed. This selective approach to forming judgments creates mental space for more important considerations.

## 6. Balance is essential for longevity

Extreme dedication can lead to burnout and shortened careers. Bowman now encourages his Olympic athletes to take breaks and pursue balance after major competitions. For example, after the Olympics, he advised Leon Marchand to take six weeks off and swimmer Reagan Smith to train lightly for several months while enjoying a more normal life.

Finding the middle ground between discipline and rest takes more sophisticated judgment than either extreme. The challenge isn't about choosing between complete dedication and abandoning standards, but rather finding sustainable rhythms. Bowman reflects that even Michael Phelps' famous 365-day training schedule might have benefited from intentional rest periods without significantly impacting his performance.

## 7. Create environments for success, don't control everything

A coach's primary job isn't to control every aspect of an athlete's life but to create environments where success becomes natural. Bowman describes his approach: "My job is to create an environment where somebody comes in and buys into what we're selling, their success will be inevitable."

This shift from controlling to enabling represents a major evolution in Bowman's coaching philosophy. Earlier in his career, he tried to control everything, which worked for short-term behavioral change but proved exhausting and potentially harmful long-term. By focusing on creating the right conditions for growth instead of micromanaging, coaches develop self-sufficient athletes who can perform even when the coach isn't present.

## 8. Be willing to challenge athletes beyond their comfort zone

A critical turning point for Bowman's program at Arizona State University came when he realized he was designing workouts his swimmers could comfortably complete rather than those that would truly challenge them. Comfortable practices made everyone feel good but didn't push growth boundaries.

When Bowman began designing workouts beyond what his swimmers had previously accomplished, he was surprised by how many rose to the challenge. Allowing athletes to occasionally fail during practice creates essential learning opportunities. This approach acknowledges that growth happens at the edge of capability, not within the safety of the familiar.

## 9. Make the decision right, don't stress about making the right decision

When contemplating his move from Arizona State to the University of Texas, Bowman was influenced by psychologist Ellen Langer's advice: "Instead of stressing about making the right decision, make the decision right." This philosophy acknowledges the impossibility of knowing which path would ultimately prove better.

Since we can only live one life and never know how alternative choices would have unfolded, the mental energy spent agonizing over perfect decisions is largely wasted. Once a reasonable choice is made with the available information, the productive approach is to commit fully to making that choice successful. This mindset reduces decision paralysis and creates empowering forward momentum.

## 10. Guide athletes, don't drive them

Bowman's coaching philosophy evolved from driving athletes to guiding them. Early in his career, when "all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail," his controlling approach could change short-term behavior but didn't create lasting independence or growth.

The guiding approach creates stronger relationships and better results, especially with mature athletes. Bowman witnessed this evolution with Michael Phelps, who gradually took more ownership of his training. By the end of Phelps' career, he could effectively analyze his own performances. The ultimate goal of coaching becomes teaching athletes to coach themselves, developing the self-awareness and judgment that sustain excellence long after formal coaching ends.
