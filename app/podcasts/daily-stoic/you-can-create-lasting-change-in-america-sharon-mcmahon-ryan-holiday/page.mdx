Here are the top 10 key takeaways from Ryan Holiday and Sharon McMahon's conversation on creating lasting change in America, drawn from their deep exploration of hidden historical figures who shaped our nation.

## 1. History favors doers, not critics

The conversation emphasizes that throughout history, the people who made lasting impacts were those who took action rather than those who simply criticized. McMahon notes that "history favors the doers and not the critics," pointing out how rarely we celebrate or remember critics compared to those who actively worked for change.

This idea appears consistently throughout their discussion of historical figures who made meaningful contributions. They highlight how people who "kept doing the next needed thing" are those history ultimately smiles upon, even if their actions seemed small at the time. These individuals weren't just commentators but active participants in creating change.

## 2. Small but mighty figures drive meaningful change

Both speakers discuss their admiration for "hidden figures" of history who made outsized impacts despite limited resources or recognition. They share examples of individuals who weren't necessarily famous but whose actions had profound ripple effects throughout history.

These "small but mighty" figures often worked outside traditional power structures yet managed to bend "the moral arc of the universe" toward justice through persistence and courage. McMahon's book specifically focuses on these types of change-makers whose contributions may have been overlooked but were nonetheless significant.

The speakers highlight how these individuals didn't wait for permission or recognition but simply took action when they saw a need. Their stories provide accessible models for how ordinary people can make extraordinary differences.

## 3. Outrage is not activism

McMahon emphasizes that feeling angry about injustice is not the same as working to change it. She states directly: "outrage is not activism" and challenges people who believe their emotional responses to problems constitute meaningful action.

Social media has exacerbated this problem by creating outlets for expressing outrage without necessarily connecting that energy to strategic action. The speakers discuss how leaving comments or changing profile pictures might feel like participation but rarely leads to tangible change.

They suggest that effective activism requires moving beyond emotional responses toward strategic action with clear goals. Without this transition from feeling to doing, outrage simply changes one's own emotional state without addressing the underlying problems.

## 4. The moral arc requires active bending

Holiday takes issue with the common phrase that "the moral arc of the universe bends toward justice," arguing that this passive framing misrepresents how change actually happens. He emphasizes that progress doesn't happen automatically but requires people actively "pulling it down" through deliberate effort.

The speakers note that for every person trying to bend the arc toward justice, others are actively working to bend it in the opposite direction. This creates an ongoing tension that requires continuous effort rather than passive trust in inevitable progress.

This perspective highlights why becoming complacent about social progress is dangerous. Without active participation in maintaining and extending positive change, regression is not just possible but likely.

## 5. Focus on the next needed thing

A recurring theme in the conversation is the importance of identifying and doing "the next needed thing" rather than becoming overwhelmed by the enormity of social problems. This approach breaks down seemingly insurmountable challenges into manageable actions.

The historical figures discussed in McMahon's book exemplify this approach. They didn't necessarily have grand five-year plans but consistently took the next logical step toward addressing injustice or creating positive change.

This framework offers a practical antidote to the paralysis that often comes from confronting massive social problems. Instead of trying to solve everything at once, doing the next needed thing creates momentum and builds toward larger change over time.

## 6. Choose issues strategically

The speakers discuss the impossibility of addressing every worthy cause and the importance of selecting specific issues where one can make meaningful contributions. They agree that having different people focused on different causes creates a healthy ecosystem of change.

McMahon notes that it's actually beneficial when people have diverse focal points, as this ensures attention across multiple important issues. This relieves the pressure to solve everything and allows people to channel their energy more effectively.

Both suggest that identifying personal strengths, experiences, and passions can help determine where someone might have the greatest impact. This strategic focusing of energy allows for deeper engagement rather than shallow involvement across too many causes.

## 7. Political power has limitations

The conversation explores how formal political channels often move slowly or ineffectively, which is why grassroots movements and individual actions are so vital for creating change. They discuss how many historical figures achieved significant impacts despite having little or no formal political power.

Holiday points out how members of Congress often abdicate their responsibility and power, while McMahon notes the executive branch receives disproportionate attention despite having limited ability to enact lasting change without legislative support. This creates a system where meaningful progress often happens outside traditional power structures.

The speakers highlight how understanding these limitations is crucial for effective activism. Rather than waiting for political leaders to act, meaningful change often requires creating pressure from outside the system or finding alternative pathways to progress.

## 8. Hope is an active choice

McMahon emphasizes that hope isn't something that descends upon people but rather something they must actively choose even in difficult circumstances. The historical figures in her book chose hope and acted upon it despite overwhelming opposition.

This framing presents hope not as an emotional state but as a deliberate stance that enables action. The speakers discuss how cynicism and nihilism provide no fertile ground for positive change, while chosen hope creates possibility.

They suggest that teaching children about this active concept of hope is crucial. Rather than shielding them from difficult realities, parents and educators should model how to acknowledge problems while still choosing to work toward solutions.

## 9. Right-size problems for effective action

When problems seem overwhelming, the speakers suggest "right-sizing" them to make action possible. This means focusing on local or specific impacts rather than trying to solve enormous issues all at once.

McMahon uses the example of addressing childhood hunger by paying off school lunch debt at a local school rather than trying to solve worldwide hunger. Starting with achievable goals creates momentum and demonstrates that individual actions do matter.

This approach also helps combat the inertia that comes from feeling powerless. By seeing tangible results from focused efforts, people gain confidence that their actions can make a difference, which encourages further engagement.

## 10. Historical context requires both honesty and hope

The speakers discuss the importance of presenting history truthfully, including uncomfortable aspects, while also highlighting stories that inspire hope and action. Holiday notes that simply focusing on past failures without providing alternative models creates cynicism.

They criticize both whitewashing history and focusing exclusively on its darkest aspects. The former leaves people feeling betrayed when they discover the truth, while the latter leaves them feeling hopeless about the possibility of improvement.

McMahon uses the metaphor of a dilapidated house to explain this balance. Just as a potential homebuyer deserves honest disclosure about problems while also needing to see the potential for improvement, students of history need both accurate information about past injustices and inspiring examples of how people have created positive change.
