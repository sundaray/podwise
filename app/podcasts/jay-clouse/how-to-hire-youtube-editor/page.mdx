Here are the top 10 key takeaways from Tony Santos' expert insights on finding, hiring, and working with YouTube editors effectively.

## 1. Finding the right editor requires looking beyond traditional freelance platforms

The most effective way to find quality YouTube editors isn't through popular platforms like Upwork or Fiverr. These platforms often attract clients seeking bargain prices rather than valuing genuine talent. Instead, successful editors recommend using social media networks, particularly Twitter, where editors showcase their work and build professional relationships.

Facebook groups like "I need an editor" and specialized websites like ytjobs.co provide better alternatives. These platforms allow creators to see immediate links to editors' portfolios and assess their dedication to the craft. The key is finding someone who demonstrates passion for video editing rather than just chasing quick money.

## 2. Pay editors fairly based on time investment, not arbitrary project rates

Tony Santos suggests paying no less than $450 per video, but this figure comes with important context. The pricing should reflect the actual time investment required, typically 20-30 hours for interview-style content. Rather than setting fixed project rates, creators should understand that quality editing demands significant time commitment.

When negotiating rates, consider the editor's hourly value and work backward from your budget. If an editor charges $50 per hour and you have $450 available, they can dedicate nine hours to your project. This approach creates realistic expectations for both parties and prevents editors from being underpaid for extensive work.

## 3. Dedicated editors outperform juggling multiple clients

The most successful editor-creator relationships involve editors who focus on fewer clients rather than spreading themselves thin across many projects. Editors working with multiple clients often can't prioritize any single creator's needs effectively. This leads to inconsistent quality and delayed turnarounds.

Creators should seek editors willing to commit long-term rather than taking on quick, one-off projects. This dedication allows editors to learn your specific style, processes, and preferences over time. The investment in finding someone committed to your channel's growth pays dividends in consistency and quality.

## 4. Technical skills matter less than compatibility and communication

While editing proficiency is important, the ability to collaborate effectively trumps technical expertise. An editor with 15 years of experience still needs time to learn your specific processes, style preferences, and channel requirements. Technical skills can be developed over time, but personality fit and communication style are harder to change.

Look for editors who ask thoughtful questions about your content and demonstrate genuine interest in your channel's mission. The best working relationships develop when both parties understand each other's working styles and can communicate openly about expectations and feedback.

## 5. Understand the difference between editing and motion graphics skills

Not every video editor can create custom animations, motion graphics, or 3D elements. These are specialized skills that require additional software knowledge and significantly more time. Many editors work primarily in editing software like Premiere Pro but may not have advanced After Effects or animation experience.

When hiring, be explicit about whether you need motion graphics work or if template-based graphics suffice. Custom animations and graphics should be factored into pricing discussions since they represent additional skill sets. If your content requires heavy motion graphics, you might need to hire specialists or pay premium rates for editors with these capabilities.

## 6. Establish clear revision limits and timelines upfront

Unlimited revisions can destroy project profitability and create unrealistic expectations. Most professional arrangements include two to three revision rounds maximum. This prevents perfectionism from derailing deadlines and helps creators focus on meaningful improvements rather than endless tweaking.

Not all revision requests carry equal weight. Fixing a typo differs vastly from restructuring an entire motion graphic sequence. Before requesting changes, consider whether the improvement justifies the time investment, especially when facing tight deadlines. Sometimes accepting minor imperfections and improving future videos proves more efficient than pursuing perfection on every project.

## 7. Project-based pricing works better than hourly rates for most YouTube content

While hourly billing seems straightforward, it creates potential conflicts over time expectations. Creators might assume a video should take ten hours while editors need fifteen, leading to disputes. Project-based pricing eliminates these timing disagreements and allows editors to work efficiently without watching the clock.

Project rates work especially well for long-term relationships where both parties understand the scope and complexity involved. Editors can balance quick projects with complex ones, while creators get predictable costs. This approach requires clear communication about deliverables and expectations before starting work.

## 8. Prepare organized assets and clear direction before hiring

Successful collaborations start with proper preparation from creators. Organize footage into clear folder structures with separate directories for A-roll, B-roll, images, and project files. Provide as many assets as possible upfront so editors can focus on creative work rather than hunting for materials.

Include inspiration references and specific examples when reaching out to potential editors. If you admire Matt D'Avella's style, mention that explicitly. This context helps editors understand your vision immediately. Clear direction prevents back-and-forth communication and allows editors to deliver results closer to your expectations on the first attempt.

## 9. Geographic location affects pricing expectations significantly

Editing rates vary dramatically based on location and market conditions. New editors should research local starting rates, which might begin around $21 per hour in some markets. However, experienced editors in major markets command much higher rates, with some Hollywood professionals earning $2,000 per day.

Understanding these market differences helps set realistic expectations on both sides. Creators should research rates in their editor's location rather than assuming universal pricing. This knowledge prevents lowball offers and helps identify when someone's rates align with their experience level and market position.

## 10. Build relationships through professional networking rather than transactional approaches

The best editor-creator partnerships often develop through genuine professional relationships rather than cold outreach. Successful editors emphasize building networks within the creative community, engaging authentically on social media, and demonstrating expertise through consistent quality work.

When reaching out to potential editors, maintain professional communication standards. Avoid casual greetings like "yo" or "hey bro." Instead, introduce yourself clearly, explain your project needs, provide portfolio links, mention style inspirations, and include your budget range upfront. This professional approach attracts serious talent and sets the foundation for productive working relationships.
