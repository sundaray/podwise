Here are the top 10 wisdom-packed insights from Charlamagne tha God's conversation with Mel Robbins that could transform your approach to life, mistakes, and personal growth.

## 1. Being of service to others is the true purpose

Charlamagne believes that our true purpose in life is to be of service to others. He emphasizes that we should first help ourselves before we can effectively help others. This means taking care of your mental health, finding healing, and putting yourself in a position where you can begin your own healing journey.

Once you've started taking care of yourself, you can then focus on serving others in various ways. This could be volunteering at a local food bank, helping someone with their groceries, or using your platform to spread positive messages. Charlamagne suggests that when you dedicate yourself to serving others, you'll see your life transform in remarkable ways and develop greater self-love.

## 2. Extend grace to your past self

Charlamagne emphasizes the importance of giving yourself grace for past mistakes. He explains that your younger self simply didn't have the knowledge or wisdom you have now. Beating yourself up for what you didn't know then makes no sense.

He describes how he mentally goes back and hugs his 8-year-old, 16-year-old, and 20-year-old versions of himself. He has conversations with these past selves, acknowledging their contributions to who he is today. This practice helps him accept all parts of his journey rather than cringing at or trying to erase past versions of himself.

This approach allows for personal growth without carrying the weight of shame or regret. Charlamagne views life as a continuous process rather than a series of "good" or "bad" events, believing everything happens for you, not to you.

## 3. If you don't deal with your trauma, your trauma will deal with you

Trauma refers to painful experiences that, when left unaddressed, can fester and affect your behavior in negative ways. Charlamagne explains that hurt people hurt people. When you don't heal from your trauma, you project that pain onto others.

He notes that 99.9% of adult issues connect back to childhood experiences. Many people self-sabotage or self-destruct through drugs, alcohol, or becoming mean and rude to others because they haven't addressed their underlying trauma. By confronting and healing from trauma, you can prevent it from controlling your life.

Therapy helped Charlamagne understand how his childhood experiences, including being molested at age eight, contributed to his people-pleasing tendencies. Recognizing these connections allowed him to begin healing and changing harmful patterns.

## 4. Positive energy activates constant elevation (PEACE)

Charlamagne shares this powerful acronym as a guiding principle. When facing difficult circumstances or making poor choices, redirecting your energy toward positive actions can transform your situation. Even when you don't know exactly what you want to do, focusing on positive energy creates momentum.

He shares his personal experience of working multiple jobs—at Taco Bell, a clothing store, telemarketing—just to avoid falling back into selling drugs. This positive redirection, despite not having a clear end goal initially, eventually led him to opportunities in radio that changed his life.

The concept emphasizes that your energy determines your trajectory. By consistently choosing positive actions over negative ones, you create an upward path that elevates your circumstances. This principle can be applied regardless of your current situation.

## 5. Let them be who they are

The "Let Them Theory" is about recognizing you can't control what other people do with the support you give them. Charlamagne discusses how people sometimes resent those who help them due to their own insecurities. Rather than taking this personally, he advises giving people the freedom to be who they are.

When you support others and they turn against you, it reveals more about their internal state than about you or your actions. This provides valuable data about who they truly are. You can continue being generous and supportive, but adjust how much time and energy you invest in relationships with people who demonstrate ingratitude.

This theory doesn't mean you should stop helping others. Instead, it means recognizing that not everyone is in the same energy space as you. Some people are operating from scarcity rather than abundance, and that's their journey to take.

## 6. Breaking generational patterns requires conscious effort

Charlamagne contrasts how his father raised him "out of fear and not love" with how he approaches parenting his four daughters. He describes his father's harsh disciplinary style, punishing him for things he was never taught. Now as a parent, Charlamagne makes different choices.

He prioritizes giving his daughters the emotional language to express themselves. He puts them in therapy not because something is wrong, but as a proactive measure. When he makes mistakes as a parent, he apologizes to his children, something his own father rarely did. His 16-year-old daughter responded to one apology by saying, "It's okay, you've never done this before," showing empathy for his learning process.

Charlamagne consciously works to create a "trauma-free childhood" for his daughters. By addressing his own issues through therapy and personal growth, he prevents passing down the same patterns that affected him. This demonstrates how healing oneself creates space for healthier relationships with the next generation.

## 7. Social media criticism should not affect your peace

Charlamagne describes social media as "an abusive relationship with our smartphones." He explains that he hasn't been on Twitter since 2019, protecting his peace by avoiding platforms where people could be needlessly cruel. He questions why anyone would subject themselves to such negativity when they wouldn't allow someone to speak to them that way in real life.

He embraces being "clueless" about what people are saying online. This intentional ignorance allows him to focus on what matters. He also points out that criticism often means you're making an impact—if no one is talking about you, you're probably not doing anything significant.

Charlamagne notes that algorithms don't distinguish between positive and negative engagement. When people argue about you in comments, whether supporters or critics, it all registers as attention to your name. This perspective helps reframe criticism as simply part of making an impact.

## 8. Breaking through the glass ceiling requires evolution

Charlamagne observed that many hip-hop radio personalities he admired eventually hit a glass ceiling in their careers because they failed to evolve. He realized he didn't want the same fate and made a conscious decision to change his approach, moving away from the "shock jock" persona that initially brought him fame.

This decision represented a significant risk. He had gained influence through a certain style, but recognized that continuing down that path would limit his growth. His evolution extended beyond his professional persona to include addressing personal issues like fidelity in his marriage and confronting family dynamics through therapy.

He points to artists like Jay-Z and Kendrick Lamar who have demonstrated similar growth in their work, addressing mature themes like therapy, fatherhood, and personal growth. This suggests that audiences are ready for authentic evolution, even if it means leaving behind the approaches that initially brought success.

## 9. Small talk wastes time and energy

Charlamagne expresses strong dislike for small talk, calling it "bullshit" because it wastes time and rarely represents genuine communication. He prefers direct conversations where people clearly state their intentions and goals rather than circling around what they really want to discuss.

He shares a story about meeting radio personality Wendy Williams for the first time. When he approached her with mixtapes and parody songs, she immediately directed him to her husband without any pleasantries. Rather than being offended, Charlamagne appreciated her directness and found it ultimately led to a meaningful professional relationship.

This approach to communication values authenticity and efficiency. By skipping meaningless chitchat and getting straight to the point, conversations become more meaningful and productive. This principle applies to both personal and professional interactions.

## 10. Gratitude transforms your perspective on challenges

Charlamagne emphasizes the power of saying "thank you" regardless of your current circumstances. Even in difficult moments, expressing gratitude acknowledges that you're alive and have purpose. This practice shifts focus from what's wrong to what's possible.

He recalls moments of being in jail, facing the consequences of poor choices, yet finding those experiences ultimately guided him toward a better path. Rather than viewing these as purely negative events, he came to see them as necessary parts of his journey that taught him valuable lessons about where he didn't want to end up.

Charlamagne suggests that when facing challenges, we should ask, "What am I supposed to learn from this moment?" This reframes difficulties as opportunities for growth rather than punishments. He emphasizes saying "thank you" even when things aren't going well, recognizing that what seems negative might actually be pushing you toward your purpose.
