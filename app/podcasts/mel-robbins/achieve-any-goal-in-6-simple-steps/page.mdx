Here are the top 10 key takeaways from Mel Robbins' podcast that will transform how you achieve your goals and create lasting change in your life.

## 1. Decide what you want

Understanding the difference between dreams and goals is crucial for success. Dreams exist in your mind and heart—they're what you imagine. Goals exist in the real world—they're what you achieve through action. To properly decide what you want, you must be specific about your desired outcome.

When setting goals, always ask yourself, "How will I know I've achieved it?" This question forces you to define clear metrics for success. If you can't measure it, it's not a goal—it's just a wish or dream. For example, wanting to be "financially free" isn't specific enough, but aiming to pay off all credit cards and have $50,000 in savings provides clear metrics.

## 2. Write it down

The physical act of writing down your goal transforms it from a thought into something tangible in the real world. Research shows that this simple act significantly increases your chances of success. When you write your goal on paper, it becomes what researchers call "external storage"—a visible reminder of what matters to you.

This written reminder triggers a process called "encoding" where your brain begins to recognize the importance of your goal. When your brain is encoded with something that matters to you, it starts filtering information differently—bringing relevant opportunities to your attention. This is similar to how you suddenly notice a particular car model everywhere after becoming interested in it.

## 3. Find the formula

For every goal you want to achieve, someone has already done it and created a pathway. These proven methods are formulas that work, and the key is to find and follow them rather than trying to reinvent the wheel. Many people mistakenly believe they need to find a unique approach when they should be leveraging existing knowledge.

People often avoid following formulas because they worry about copying others or not being original enough. This is a mistake that can cost years of progress. Even when following an established formula, your unique personality and circumstances ensure your execution will still be distinctively yours. Remember: other people don't block your way—they lead the way.

## 4. Do the reps

The unglamorous truth about achieving goals is that success comes from consistently doing boring, tedious actions—the "reps." There are no magic shortcuts or exciting hacks. The difference between those who achieve their goals and those who don't is simply showing up daily to do the work, especially when it's unpleasant.

Creating an implementation intention can help you stick with your reps. This is a simple written statement in the format: "I will [action] at [time] in [place]." Research shows that 91% of people who write down such specific plans follow through, compared to much lower rates for those who just think about their goals. When motivation inevitably falters, use techniques like the five-second rule (count 5-4-3-2-1 and move) or acknowledging the difficulty before proceeding anyway.

## 5. Make it fun and easy

Once you've accepted that achieving goals requires tedious work and you've established a routine of doing the reps, look for ways to reduce friction. Create visual reminders, eliminate unnecessary decisions, and set up your environment to make the right choices easier. For example, laying out exercise clothes the night before removes one decision barrier in the morning.

According to habit researcher James Clear, you will rise or fall to the level of your systems. By designing your environment and creating routines that support your goals, you can make consistency easier. Consider joining communities, taking classes, or finding accountability partners to add social elements that make the process more enjoyable.

## 6. Don't quit

The final step to achieving any goal is simple but crucial: persist until completion. Every success story includes moments of doubt, failure, and the temptation to give up. What separates those who achieve their goals from those who don't isn't talent or luck—it's the refusal to quit when things get difficult.

There will inevitably be days, weeks, or even months when you don't do your reps. What defines success isn't perfect consistency but rather your willingness to return after those breaks. The day you resume your efforts after stopping is often more important than all the days you didn't miss. Remember that timelines for achievement are often beyond your control, but your decision to keep showing up is always within your power.

## 7. Distinguish between dreams and goals

Dreams have no deadlines or metrics—they exist only in your imagination and feelings. Goals, however, have specific parameters, timelines, and measurable outcomes. This fundamental difference determines whether something remains a pleasant thought or becomes a real achievement.

The language you use reflects this distinction. Compare "I dream of writing a book" versus "I have a goal of writing a book this year." The first statement exists solely in your mind, while the second commits you to action in the real world. Converting vague aspirations into concrete goals with clear metrics is the first step toward making them reality.

## 8. Overcome fear of judgment

Many people know what they want and even understand the formula for achieving it, but remain paralyzed by fear of others' opinions. Mel Robbins admits spending two years unable to market her speaking business on social media because she worried what friends would think. This fear of judgment can silently sabotage your progress.

The solution is what she calls the "Let Them Theory"—giving others permission to think whatever they want while giving yourself permission to do what you need to do. The philosophy is simple: "Let them think, say, and feel however they're going to feel" combined with "Let me do the things I need to do to achieve my goal." This mindset shift creates instant freedom and power by redirecting energy from managing others' perceptions to taking action.

## 9. Track your progress

Setting specific metrics allows you to monitor your journey and know when you've achieved success. Without clear tracking mechanisms, goals remain ambiguous and success becomes subjective rather than definitive. For example, saying "I want to be healthier" provides no way to measure progress, but "I want to reduce my cholesterol to below 200" gives you a concrete target.

When you establish clear metrics, you create accountability for yourself. This specificity transforms vague aspirations into actionable plans with definable outcomes. The process of tracking progress also provides momentum and motivation as you see yourself advancing toward your goal.

## 10. Accept the unglamorous reality of achievement

Changing your life isn't glamorous—it's grueling work that requires consistent effort over extended periods. Success doesn't come from secrets or hacks but from the willingness to do what most people won't. This means showing up daily regardless of motivation levels and slowly chipping away at your goals, often for years.

Understanding this reality before you begin prevents disappointment and quitting when the initial excitement fades. Progress is typically painstakingly slow, with many days where your only win is being slightly better than the day before. Accepting this unglamorous truth up front helps maintain realistic expectations and sustain effort through inevitable plateaus and setbacks.
