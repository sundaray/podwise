Here are the top 10 key takeaways from Harvard Business School Professor Alison Wood Brooks' conversation with Mel Robbins on mastering career success, negotiation, and effective communication.

## 1. Focus on what others need

Understanding what others need is the foundation of effective negotiation and influence. Instead of approaching conversations with a "me against you" mindset, successful negotiators focus on discovering what the other person values and needs. This shift in perspective turns confrontation into collaboration.

The best way to position yourself for success is by asking questions like "What would make your life easier?" or "What do you value in an employee?" This approach helps you understand how you can become invaluable to them. When you demonstrate that you're focused on helping solve their problems, you naturally become more influential.

## 2. Make your contributions known

Most people assume others notice their hard work and accomplishments, but this is rarely true. According to research, one of the biggest factors determining whether someone gets promoted is whether their contributions are known. This is especially important for women and minorities in the workplace.

A practical strategy is keeping notes of your accomplishments and sharing them regularly. Professor Brooks recommends sending a weekly email to your boss summarizing what you've accomplished, what you're still working on, and asking about priorities. Another effective approach is documenting solutions to problems you've solved and sharing them widely to increase your visibility.

## 3. Replace anxiety with excitement

When facing nerve-wracking situations like interviews or negotiations, trying to calm down is ineffective because anxiety is a high-arousal emotional state. Instead, Professor Brooks's groundbreaking research shows that reframing anxiety as excitement is much more effective because it maintains the same physiological state while shifting the emotional valence from negative to positive.

By saying "I'm excited" out loud before important events, you redirect your focus from potential threats to potential opportunities. This simple reframe helps you maintain access to your preparation while performing better under pressure. Remember that feeling anxious is actually a healthy response indicating you care about the outcome.

## 4. Connect before you convince

The most successful people focus on building meaningful connections rather than trying to prove how great they are. Contrary to popular belief, effective negotiation isn't about being rigid, tough, or persuasive. It's about developing relationships, understanding others' needs, and figuring out how to deliver value.

When approaching any conversation where you want to influence someone, start by seeking to understand their perspective completely before making your case. This creates a collaborative atmosphere where the other person feels seen and heard, making them more receptive to your ideas and requests.

## 5. Value relationships beyond money

While financial compensation is important, workplace happiness depends on many other factors. When negotiating, consider benefits beyond salary such as flexible scheduling, better work environments, meaningful projects, or opportunities for growth and connection.

If a company can't meet your salary requirements, think creatively about other valuable concessions. You might negotiate for a four-day workweek, remote work options, better title, or additional vacation time. These non-monetary benefits often contribute more to overall satisfaction than a modest salary increase would.

## 6. Approach networking with genuine curiosity

Effective networking isn't about impressive elevator pitches or collecting business cards. It's about initiating authentic conversations driven by sincere curiosity. When meeting new professional contacts, ask questions about their work, challenges, and interests rather than immediately focusing on what you want.

The key to memorable networking is follow-up. After a conversation, send a quick message expressing gratitude and referencing something specific you discussed. This demonstrates attentiveness and strengthens the connection. Even brief five-minute conversations can lead to meaningful professional relationships when followed by thoughtful follow-up.

## 7. Prepare for interview questions strategically

When faced with open-ended interview questions like "Tell me about yourself," have a structured approach ready. Professor Brooks suggests responding with, "I'll share two things about my professional life and two things about my personal life," which immediately demonstrates organization and preparation.

This framework allows you to highlight relevant professional experiences while also showing your personality. When preparing for interviews, anticipate common questions and practice answers that showcase your unique value. Rather than trying to be perfect, focus on creating connection through authentic, well-prepared responses.

## 8. Learn from high performers

Instead of feeling jealous of successful colleagues, study what makes them effective. High performers often exhibit specific communication patterns and work habits that you can adopt. When you see someone excelling, ask yourself what behaviors they demonstrate that you could incorporate.

This approach transforms social comparison from a negative experience into a learning opportunity. Rather than dismissing successful people as naturally talented, recognize that they're demonstrating skills and behaviors you can develop. Ask questions about their approach and be willing to mirror effective strategies.

## 9. Use a learning mindset in negotiations

The mindset of trying to be persuasive can undermine your effectiveness in negotiations. Instead, approach conversations with a learning mindset, seeking to gather as much information as possible about the other person's position, priorities, and constraints.

When you enter negotiations as a collaborative problem-solver rather than an adversary, you create space for creative solutions. This approach feels less confrontational and often leads to better outcomes for both parties. The irony is that by focusing less on persuading and more on learning, you ultimately become more persuasive.

## 10. Light up conversations one at a time

Professor Brooks uses the metaphor of conversations as lightbulbs on a string, representing your relationships over time. The goal is to make each interaction "glow a little brighter," recognizing that not every conversation will be perfect or successful.

This perspective helps maintain resilience through career challenges. Some conversations may not go as planned, but they're still part of your journey. By focusing on making each interaction meaningful rather than perfect, you develop stronger communication skills and build more influential relationships over time. Remember that future opportunities always exist, even after setbacks.
