Here are the top 10 key takeaways from Scott D. Clary's conversation with Kyle Landry, scientist-entrepreneur and President of Delavie Sciences, who's pioneering revolutionary skincare products developed from organisms that survive in extreme environments.

## 1. Food science is an underappreciated applied science with extensive real-world applications

Kyle Landry initially studied food science by chance, which became the foundation for his entire career. He describes food science as "one of the most applied sciences you can go for" because it aims to create products that everyone will consume or touch.

Food science encompasses diverse areas including food microbiology, food safety, product design, and food engineering. Despite its critical importance to humanity's food supply, Landry notes it remains severely underappreciated despite having one of the highest job placement rates in any field. The universal applicability of food science techniques allowed him to transition seamlessly into other scientific domains later in his career.

## 2. Scientific techniques are widely transferable across different domains

Landry emphasizes that scientific methods are universal and transferable across different fields. He explains how the techniques he learned in food science could be applied to genetics and longevity research. This flexibility allowed him to pivot from studying bean sprouts to working in cosmetics.

The toolbox of scientific skills he developed proved useful beyond his original field. According to Landry, "Science is the same thing. All the techniques that I learned and used can be applied to all other sciences." This transferability enabled him to work with David Sinclair at Harvard Medical School on longevity research despite his background in food science, as the fundamental scientific approaches remained consistent regardless of the specific application.

## 3. Space research has direct applications for everyday consumer products

Landry's work with NASA and JPL led to groundbreaking discoveries with practical applications. His research involved studying bacteria that survived on the International Space Station and applying those findings to develop consumer skincare products with unique protective properties.

The organism that survived outside the space station for over a year demonstrated remarkable UV protection capabilities. Landry and his team extended this protection to cover UVB and UVA ranges, making it valuable for commercial sunscreens. This innovation addresses a significant gap in the sunscreen market, where little innovation has occurred in recent years. The resulting product not only blocks UV radiation but also activates DNA repair mechanisms in skin cells, helping reduce age spots and other signs of aging.

## 4. Marketing often obscures the true science behind cosmetic products

Landry reveals that the cosmetics industry frequently makes claims without substantial scientific evidence. Many products rely on subjective questionnaires rather than rigorous testing. Most companies simply ask if users feel their skin improved rather than measuring actual changes.

Delavie Sciences takes a different approach by conducting comprehensive testing that includes tissue cultures, enzyme assays, expert grading, before-and-after images with computer analysis, and subjective questionnaires. This scientific rigor contrasts sharply with industry norms where companies often make claims based solely on ingredients without testing if those ingredients remain active in the final formulation. Many brands use the same ingredients from the same suppliers but simply change the packaging and celebrity endorsements.

## 5. Consumer products often lack rigorous scientific testing

The regulatory environment for cosmetics and supplements allows products to reach market with minimal testing. Unlike pharmaceuticals, these products can make claims without proving efficacy. Landry notes that many companies base claims on ingredients rather than testing the final product.

This lack of oversight creates a "minefield" for consumers seeking effective products. Landry explains that "you can go to market, not do any testing, base your claims on the ingredients you have in the product, but you don't even know if the ingredients are active in your formulation." Many companies make claims like "98% of people think their skin looked better after using it for a day" based on tiny sample sizes of around 10 people. The difference between "scientifically proven" and "clinically tested" is significant but often misunderstood by consumers.

## 6. Entrepreneurial scientists must balance perfectionism with market realities

Scientists-turned-entrepreneurs often struggle with perfectionism, which can prevent products from ever reaching the market. Landry advises finding a balance between scientific rigor and commercial viability. He stresses the importance of launching a good product rather than endlessly pursuing perfection.

"You have to get it to a point where it's acceptable and it's functional and it'll make an impact in the market," Landry explains. Launching allows for customer feedback and iterative improvements. He's seen many scientists with great ideas who never launch because they're constantly refining, only to be overtaken by competitors. The key is recognizing when a product is good enough to release while planning for future improvements based on market response.

## 7. Health fundamentals outweigh trendy biohacks

Despite the popularity of health trends like cold plunges and hyperbaric chambers, Landry emphasizes that basic health practices yield the greatest benefits. He recommends focusing on sleep, exercise, hydration, and diet before exploring specialized biohacking techniques.

These four fundamentals will "outweigh any of the benefits you'd get from a cold plunge," according to Landry. He cautions against using trendy health hacks to compensate for poor lifestyle choices. People often use these interventions to feel better about themselves after unhealthy behaviors rather than addressing the root causes of poor health. While calorie restriction through intermittent fasting has proven longevity benefits, most other interventions offer minimal value without the foundational elements in place.

## 8. Extreme environments yield powerful biological innovations

Landry's research involves finding organisms in extreme environments and studying how they survive harsh conditions. These "extremophiles" have developed unique protective mechanisms that can be applied to human health. His work has taken him 5,000 feet underground into abandoned mines and to other challenging locations.

These organisms produce compounds that protect against oxidative stress and DNA damage. By isolating these protective mechanisms, Landry has developed ingredients that help human skin resist similar stresses. One example is bacteria that survived outside the International Space Station, which led to the development of a powerful UV-protective compound. His research also extended to remediating the BP oil spill by finding bacteria from pine tree roots that could break down petroleum hydrocarbons.

## 9. Building businesses requires finding the right supporters

Landry warns about "false prophets" who claim they'll help entrepreneurs but don't contribute meaningfully. He stresses the importance of finding people who will actually assist with the challenging work of building a business rather than just offering advice. This applies to both mentors and investors.

Finding investors with aligned goals is equally crucial. Some investors may pressure founders to exit within a specific timeframe, which might conflict with the founder's vision. Landry advises entrepreneurs to "find someone or have terms in their contracts that allow you to still grow without having to be forced into something." He emphasizes the importance of due diligence when selecting business partners and ensuring they share your mindset and timeline.

## 10. Balancing multiple interests creates fulfillment and enhances creativity

Despite his demanding scientific career, Landry maintains numerous other interests including art collecting, teaching, real estate, and hands-on projects like building decks and fixing pinball machines. These diverse activities provide balance and creative fulfillment rather than distraction.

Landry views these pursuits as complementary rather than competitive with his primary work. Working with his hands on tangible projects provides immediate satisfaction compared to scientific research where results may take years. This variety of activities creates cognitive balance and prevents burnout. Landry applies the same analytical thinking across all his endeavors, seeing connections between seemingly disparate fields. This interdisciplinary approach enhances his problem-solving abilities and brings fresh perspectives to his primary scientific work.
