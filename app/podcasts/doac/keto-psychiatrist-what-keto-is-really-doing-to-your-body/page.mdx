Here are the top 10 key takeaways from Dr. Georgia Ede's discussion about ketogenic diets and mental health on "The Diary of A CEO" podcast that reveal surprising connections between what we eat and our mental wellbeing.

## 1. The three fundamental principles of brain nutrition

Dr. Georgia Ede outlines three core principles for optimal brain nutrition. First, we must nourish our brain with all essential nutrients, which requires including some animal foods in our diet. Second, we need to protect our brain by removing inflammatory foods such as refined carbohydrates and vegetable oils that cause oxidative stress.

Third, we must energize our brain by providing clean, reliable energy through proper glucose and insulin regulation. These principles form the foundation of her approach to treating mental health conditions through diet. The brain requires specific nutrients and energy management to function optimally, and conventional nutrition advice often misses these critical factors.

## 2. The ketogenic diet fundamentally changes brain chemistry

The ketogenic diet was originally created in 1921 as a treatment for children with severe epilepsy. It works by changing the brain's "operating system" through altering its fuel source. When switching from a high-carbohydrate diet to a low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet, the brain begins using ketones for energy instead of glucose.

This metabolic shift affects virtually every chemical pathway inside brain cells. The ketogenic diet reduces inflammation, decreases oxidative stress, improves insulin resistance, and balances brain chemicals like serotonin, dopamine, and GABA. These changes allow brain cells to function better and enable healing processes to take place, which explains why the diet can have profound effects on various mental health conditions.

## 3. A clinical study showed remarkable results for treatment-resistant mental illness

Dr. Ede discussed a study conducted by Dr. Albert Dana in France where 31 patients with treatment-resistant bipolar disorder, major depression, or schizophrenia tried a ketogenic diet. These patients had been ill for an average of 10 years and were taking an average of five psychiatric medications when entering the study.

The results were striking: 43% of participants achieved clinical remission from their primary psychiatric condition, and 64% left the hospital on fewer psychiatric medications. All patients showed metabolic improvements as well. Such dramatic improvements are rarely seen in conventional psychiatric care, highlighting the potential of ketogenic diets as a therapeutic approach for mental health conditions.

## 4. Mental health conditions are linked to metabolic health

Dr. Ede explains that many mental health conditions are fundamentally metabolic disorders. When cells cannot properly produce energy, various systems break down, leading to different mental and physical conditions depending on a person's genetic predispositions and life experiences. This perspective reframes conditions like depression, anxiety, and ADHD as manifestations of cellular dysfunction.

The connection between metabolic health and mental health is supported by epidemiological data. Children with obesity are twice as likely to have ADHD, and adults with type 2 diabetes are twice as likely to have ADHD. These correlations suggest that addressing underlying metabolic issues through dietary interventions could be an effective approach to treating mental health conditions.

## 5. Insulin regulation is the key mechanism behind ketogenic benefits

The ketogenic diet's effectiveness stems primarily from its ability to lower insulin levels. Insulin is not just a blood sugar regulator but a master metabolic hormone that affects every cell in the body. High insulin levels prevent fat burning and keep people on a metabolic "roller coaster" that affects mood, energy, and cognitive function.

When insulin levels are lowered through a ketogenic diet, the body can access stored fat for energy, producing ketones that provide stable fuel for the brain. This stabilizes not only blood sugar but also stress hormones, reproductive hormones, and satiety signals. The reduction in these hormonal fluctuations explains why many people report reduced anxiety, improved mental clarity, and better emotional stability on a ketogenic diet.

## 6. Personalization is essential in dietary approaches

Dr. Ede emphasizes that while certain nutritional principles apply to everyone, the ideal diet varies between individuals. Different people have different metabolic health levels, food sensitivities, activity levels, ages, and health goals that affect their optimal dietary approach. There is no one-size-fits-all solution.

Some people may benefit from a strict ketogenic diet, while others might do well with a more moderate low-carbohydrate approach. Factors like exercise intensity can also affect carbohydrate requirements. Dr. Ede encourages a personalized approach that takes into account individual preferences, metabolic health, and lifestyle factors to determine the optimal diet for each person.

## 7. Modern ultra-processed foods are engineered to be addictive

Modern food products are designed by chemical engineers to be both irresistible and unsatisfying, creating a cycle of overconsumption. These ultra-processed foods bypass the body's natural satiety signals, making it difficult for people to control their intake. This explains why many people struggle with food cravings and addiction.

In contrast, whole foods like meat, seafood, and vegetables are naturally satisfying and regulate appetite effectively. When people switch to a whole foods diet, especially one that stabilizes insulin levels like a ketogenic diet, they often experience a dramatic reduction in cravings and food obsession. Many report being able to go for extended periods without thinking about food, which is nearly impossible on a standard high-carbohydrate diet.

## 8. Ketogenic diets can significantly reduce anxiety

One of the most consistent benefits reported with ketogenic diets is reduced anxiety. According to Dr. Ede, most people experience substantial reductions in anxiety within three days to three weeks of starting a ketogenic diet. This occurs partly because the diet stabilizes blood sugar and insulin levels, which in turn stabilizes stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol.

Research has shown that sugar consumption can significantly impact stress hormone levels. In one study, healthy teenage boys who consumed sugar-sweetened cola had quadrupled adrenaline levels 4-5 hours after consumption compared to those who drank sugar-free cola. This illustrates how dietary choices directly affect our stress response independent of external stressors, explaining why dietary changes can have such profound effects on anxiety.

## 9. Ketosis is a metabolic state that enables healing

Ketosis is defined as having blood ketone levels of 0.5 millimoles or higher, which occurs when glucose and insulin levels drop and liver glycogen is partially depleted. This metabolic state activates numerous healing and maintenance pathways in the body that remain dormant when continuously burning carbohydrates for fuel.

Dr. Ede believes that all humans need to spend some time in ketosis regularly to allow cellular repair and maintenance. She compares the body to a manufacturing plant that needs downtime for cleaning and repairs. Without periods of ketosis, the body cannot properly heal itself. This can be achieved through various methods including ketogenic diets, intermittent fasting, or exercise, but a well-formulated ketogenic diet is the most sustainable way to maintain ketosis long-term.

## 10. Conventional nutrition education lacks focus on brain health

Throughout medical school and psychiatry residency, Dr. Ede received minimal education about nutrition, with virtually no information about the relationship between food and brain health. This knowledge gap in medical education has led to a disconnect between dietary recommendations and brain health outcomes.

Most nutrition advice focuses on heart health or weight management rather than optimizing brain function. Additionally, much of conventional nutrition guidance stems from questionnaire-based epidemiological studies rather than clinical trials or biological mechanisms. Dr. Ede argues that many commonly held beliefs about nutrition are based on untested theories rather than rigorous science. This explains why dietary interventions that contradict conventional wisdom, like ketogenic diets, can produce surprising benefits for mental health that aren't predicted by mainstream nutritional guidelines.
