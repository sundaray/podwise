Here are the top 10 takeaways from Dr. Victoria Samson's interview on "The Diary of A CEO" about how your oral microbiome impacts your overall health in ways you never imagined.


## 1. The oral microbiome is the second largest microbiome in the body
The oral microbiome contains approximately 700 different bacteria species, totaling about 2 billion bacteria overall. What makes the oral microbiome unique compared to other microbiomes in the body is that it contains many different environments or "niches" within the same mouth. These different areas—under the gums, back of the throat, on teeth—create various environments that host different types of bacteria.

Unlike the gut microbiome which has natural turnover through peristalsis and movement, the oral microbiome doesn't naturally shed. Teeth are the only non-shedding surfaces in the entire body. Without mechanical disruption through brushing or professional cleaning, bacteria in the mouth will continuously grow and accumulate, potentially leading to various health issues.

## 2. Oral health impacts overall health through two primary mechanisms
The oral microbiome affects overall health primarily through bacterial spread and inflammation. Bad bacteria from the mouth can travel to other parts of the body through swallowing, breathing, or directly through the bloodstream, potentially causing infections elsewhere. This is why patients with heart valve issues can't have dental cleanings for months after surgery—oral bacteria could cause deadly heart valve infections.

The second mechanism is through inflammation. Gum disease creates what's called "low-grade chronic inflammation" where inflammatory markers released by bacteria in the mouth can travel throughout the body and contribute to inflammation elsewhere. For example, the inflammation from gum disease can worsen arthritis symptoms in other parts of the body. Additionally, toxic enzymes released by bad oral bacteria can damage blood vessels, affecting their ability to dilate and constrict properly.

## 3. There is a strong link between gum disease and major health conditions
Research has shown clear connections between gum disease and several serious health conditions. People with gum disease are 20% more likely to have high blood pressure and up to 30-40% of cardiac issues in hospitals can be traced back to oral bacteria. Those with gum disease are twice as likely to have a heart attack and three times more likely to have a stroke than those without inflammatory gum disease.

Men with periodontal disease are 2.85 times more likely to suffer from erectile dysfunction due to reduced blood flow caused by damaged blood vessels. There's also emerging research showing connections between specific oral bacteria and various cancers, including breast and colorectal cancer. The specific oral bacteria Fusobacterium nucleatum has been found in higher concentrations in breast tissue of women with breast cancer compared to those without.

## 4. The oral microbiome has a significant impact on brain health
Research has demonstrated a concerning link between oral health and neurological conditions. A six-year study of 11,000 children found that those with sleep-disordered breathing were 50-90% more likely to develop ADHD-like symptoms than normal breathers who used their nose correctly. This is primarily due to reduced oxygen delivery to the brain.

Another study tracking over 20,000 people for 20 years found that individuals with gum disease for more than 10 years had a 70% increased chance of developing Alzheimer's disease. Further research discovered that 97% of Alzheimer's patients had toxic enzymes called gingipains (produced by oral bacteria P. gingivalis) in their brain tissue, compared to zero in those without Alzheimer's. These enzymes can cross the blood-brain barrier and break down neurons and brain tissue. Additionally, Alzheimer's patients with gum disease showed more rapid cognitive decline than those without gum disease.

## 5. Oral health directly affects fertility in both men and women
A remarkable study found that over 90% of subfertile men (men who couldn't conceive with their partners) had some form of oral infection or dental disease. When these men received proper dental treatment, there was a 70% improvement in pregnancy success rates. Six months after treatment, their sperm quality improved by 20%, and after eight months, 50% of their wives were pregnant.

For women, research has shown that those with gum disease are less likely to ovulate and typically take two months longer to conceive compared to women without gum disease. Pregnant women with gum disease also face higher risks of pre-term birth, low birth weight babies, and preeclampsia. A large study in Malawi (which has the world's highest rate of pre-term births) showed that providing pregnant women with sugar-free chewing gum, toothbrushes, and toothpaste reduced pre-term births by 20% compared to the control group.

## 6. Modern diets have changed our mouth structure and contributed to dental issues
Our shift to processed, softer foods has negatively impacted jaw development and dental health. Research by Weston Price comparing twins raised in industrialized versus non-industrialized areas showed that those eating harder, less processed foods developed better jaws with no crowding or decay. Their teeth had room to grow properly.

Modern diets featuring softer, more processed foods have resulted in underdeveloped jaws while teeth remain the same size. This mismatch leads to crowding, impacted wisdom teeth, and increased need for orthodontic treatment. Interestingly, our ancestors didn't have dentists, braces, or even toothpaste, yet they didn't suffer from the dental issues that are common today due to their harder, less processed diet.

## 7. Proper oral hygiene requires specific techniques and timing
Many common dental hygiene practices are actually counterproductive. For instance, contrary to instinct, you should never brush your teeth immediately after consuming something acidic or sugary. Doing so can grind the sugar or acid into your teeth. Instead, wait 30 minutes before brushing and use sugar-free gum or mints in the meantime to neutralize saliva.

After brushing, you should spit but not rinse with water. Dr. Samson compares it to applying sunscreen then immediately showering—rinsing washes away the protective benefits of toothpaste. When brushing, use circular motions at a 30-degree angle toward the gum margin, and follow a methodical pattern rather than brushing randomly. Most people only brush for 20-30 seconds when they should aim for two minutes, and often miss the insides of the back bottom teeth near the tongue.

## 8. The oral microbiome is highly personal and influenced by multiple factors
Everyone's oral microbiome is different and affected by numerous factors. While bacteria presence is important, equally crucial is how your body responds to that bacteria. Some people have genetic mutations that cause their bodies to react more aggressively to even small amounts of bacteria, predisposing them to gum disease despite good hygiene.

Your oral microbiome is influenced by diet, stress levels, kissing (transferring bacteria between partners if done more than 11 times daily), oral sex, and even pet interactions. Dr. Samson shared an example of a patient with persistent bad breath whose oral microbiome was 40% composed of bacteria typically found in dogs—the result of frequently kissing her pets who had gum disease. Testing your oral microbiome can reveal these personalized patterns and help develop targeted treatment strategies.

## 9. Mouth breathing negatively impacts overall health
Breathing through your mouth rather than your nose can have significant health consequences. Unlike the nose, which serves as a filter with temperature regulation and mucus to catch bacteria, the mouth has no filtering mechanism. This allows unfiltered air and potential pathogens direct access to your respiratory system.

Mouth breathing is often associated with underdeveloped jaws or misaligned teeth that prevent proper lip closure. Children who are mouth breathers frequently exhibit ADHD-like symptoms, bedwetting, teeth grinding, and various other issues. While it's relatively easy to correct in children whose jaws are still developing, it becomes more challenging in adults. Mouth taping (applying tape to keep the mouth closed during sleep) has gained popularity as a way to promote nose breathing and improve sleep quality.

## 10. Simple interventions can significantly improve oral microbiome health
Several accessible interventions can dramatically improve oral microbiome health. Green tea, for instance, is highly effective at killing Fusobacterium nucleatum (a harmful oral bacteria linked to cancer). Using straws when consuming sugary or acidic drinks helps bypass the teeth, reducing decay and staining. Sugar-free chewing gum stimulates saliva production and can be naturally antibacterial.

For those with specific concerns, probiotics designed for oral health can introduce beneficial bacteria to counteract harmful ones. When consuming sugary foods, it's better to have them all at once rather than sipping or snacking throughout the day, which repeatedly lowers pH and doesn't allow saliva to neutralize. Testing your oral microbiome can provide personalized recommendations for products and habits that will specifically address your unique bacterial profile and genetic predispositions.
