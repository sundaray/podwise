Here are the top 10 key takeaways from toxicologist Dr. Yvonne Burkart's interview on environmental toxins that could be affecting your health and fertility without your knowledge.

## 1. Endocrine disruptors in everyday products can cause serious health issues

Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that interfere with our hormonal systems, affecting everything from metabolism to fertility and brain function. These chemicals are particularly concerning because they can be harmful even at very low doses. Unlike traditional toxins where higher doses cause more harm, some endocrine disruptors can be more active at lower levels than at higher concentrations.

These disruptors are found in numerous everyday products including plastic containers, non-stick cookware, fragranced personal care items, and beauty products. They've been linked to increased rates of cancer, infertility, obesity, and neurodevelopmental delays in children. The pervasiveness of these chemicals in our environment means virtually everyone is being exposed without their knowledge or consent.

## 2. Fragrance in products often contains harmful chemicals

The term "fragrance" or "parfum" on ingredient labels serves as an umbrella term that can legally hide numerous harmful chemicals. Manufacturers are not required to disclose the specific ingredients in fragrances as they're considered trade secrets in both the US and Europe. These hidden mixtures often contain known carcinogens, endocrine disruptors like phthalates, and potent allergens.

Phthalates are particularly concerning as they help fragrances stick to surfaces and linger longer. They're used as "film formers" in products, which explains why scents last for hours. The pervasiveness of fragranced products has led to what Dr. Burkart describes as "the new second-hand smoke," with these chemicals binding to household dust and remaining in indoor environments long after application.

## 3. Microplastics are accumulating in human bodies with unknown consequences

Microplastics are being found throughout human bodies - in lungs, hearts, brains, reproductive organs, and even in newborn babies. These plastic particles don't break down in the body and instead accumulate over time. Scientists have found that if current trends continue, humans may eventually contain more plastic than human material.

These particles cause inflammation and oxidative stress at the cellular level, creating what Dr. Burkart describes as "a million little fires all over your body." The body's detoxification resources become strained as they attempt to address both normal metabolic processes and these foreign particles. Common sources of microplastic exposure include plastic water bottles (especially when heated), food containers, synthetic clothing, and non-stick cookware when scratched.

## 4. Children are especially vulnerable to environmental toxins

Children are particularly susceptible to environmental toxins because their bodies are still developing and they cannot effectively detoxify harmful chemicals. A child's detoxification capacity isn't fully developed until around age 10, meaning toxins remain in their bodies longer and can cause more damage during critical developmental periods.

Exposure to endocrine disruptors during childhood has been linked to early puberty, cognitive delays, behavioral issues, increased obesity, and even cancer. Children are also more likely to ingest household dust (which binds with toxins) as they crawl on floors and put things in their mouths. Dr. Burkart emphasizes that many childhood conditions currently considered common may actually be preventable consequences of toxic exposure.

## 5. Non-stick cookware releases harmful PFAS chemicals into food

PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are "forever chemicals" used in non-stick cookware that don't break down in the environment or our bodies. Studies have shown that even microscopic scratches in non-stick pans can release thousands of particles into food. A surface scratch can release 9,000 particles, while a crack can release up to 2.3 billion particles.

These chemicals have been linked to kidney and testicular cancer, thyroid disorders, reproductive issues including miscarriage and preeclampsia, and increased obesity. They can make weight loss difficult regardless of diet. Dr. Burkart recommends alternatives like cast iron, stainless steel, glass, or ceramic cookware to avoid PFAS exposure from cooking surfaces.

## 6. Toxin exposure can affect multiple generations

When a pregnant woman is exposed to toxins, not only is her developing baby exposed, but potentially her grandchildren as well. This multigenerational toxicity occurs because when a female fetus is developing in the womb, her eggs (which will someday become her children) are also forming and can be affected by the environmental chemicals present.

This creates a scenario where toxin exposure can cause epigenetic changes - alterations to DNA that affect how genes are expressed - which can be passed down through generations. This means even if a person lives a "clean" lifestyle, they may still have predispositions to certain conditions based on their grandmother's or great-grandmother's exposures to environmental toxins decades earlier.

## 7. Personal care and beauty products are significant sources of toxin exposure

Beauty and personal care products represent a significant source of toxin exposure because many contain harmful ingredients that are applied directly to the skin or mucous membranes. Leave-on products like foundations, moisturizers, and sunscreens pose higher risks than rinse-off products because they remain on the skin longer, allowing more time for chemicals to be absorbed.

Studies have shown that removing certain ingredients from beauty and personal care products for just 28 days can significantly reduce breast cancer gene expression in women. Products marketed to Black women often contain more harmful ingredients, with 50% of products marketed to Black women containing endocrine disruptors compared to only 7% of those marketed to white women. This disparity represents what Dr. Burkart calls "environmental injustice."

## 8. Indoor air quality can be worse than outdoor air

Indoor air quality can be up to five times worse than outdoor air, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. This surprising statistic is due to inadequate ventilation combined with numerous indoor pollution sources. Common contributors to poor indoor air quality include fragranced products, candles, air fresheners, cleaning products, and wood-burning fireplaces.

Conventional candles are particularly problematic as they release carcinogens like benzene, toluene, and formaldehyde when burned. They also produce ultrafine particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs and directly enter the bloodstream. Dr. Burkart recommends simple measures to improve indoor air quality, such as opening windows regularly (even in cold weather), keeping shoes at the door to prevent tracking in outdoor pollutants, dusting and cleaning regularly, and using beeswax candles with essential oils instead of conventional scented candles.

## 9. The body's detoxification capacity can be supported and improved

The body has natural detoxification mechanisms, primarily through a compound called glutathione, which is produced mainly in the liver and kidneys. This "master antioxidant" helps neutralize harmful substances and remove them from the body. However, modern lifestyles and chemical exposures can deplete glutathione levels, compromising our ability to detoxify effectively.

Several factors can support glutathione production, including regular exercise, adequate sleep, and consuming sulfur-rich foods like cruciferous vegetables, eggs, and meat. Matcha green tea can also provide building blocks for glutathione production. Equally important is reducing exposure to substances that deplete glutathione, such as alcohol, cigarettes, ultra-processed foods, fragranced products, and non-stick cookware.

## 10. Small changes in product choices can significantly reduce toxic exposure

Making small, incremental changes to product choices can substantially reduce toxic exposure without requiring a complete lifestyle overhaul. Simple swaps include using stainless steel or glass water bottles instead of plastic, choosing fragrance-free personal care products, filtering water, cooking at home with safer cookware, and removing shoes at the door.

Dr. Burkart emphasizes that the goal isn't perfection or fear but empowerment through knowledge. She notes that when she made these changes in her own life, she was able to reverse her fertility issues without medical intervention. Not everyone needs to throw away all their possessions immediately, but becoming more conscious of product choices and gradually replacing harmful items with safer alternatives can have significant positive impacts on health over time.
