Here are the top 10 key takeaways from Ben Mercer's remarkable journey from professional rugby player to TikTok book influencer, revealing how unconventional career pivots can lead to unexpected success.

## 1. Traditional career scripts can become obsolete quickly

Ben grew up with classic expectations around work. His doctor parents worked long hours in demanding but rewarding careers. The educational path was clear: get good grades, attend university, and secure a prestigious job in finance, law, or medicine. This system worked well before 2008, when English literature graduates could easily transition into city banking or consulting roles.

The 2008 financial crisis shattered these assumptions midway through university for many students. Friends ahead of Ben struggled with unpaid internships and limited opportunities at major firms. However, Ben was insulated from this immediate impact because he had already committed to professional rugby. This gave him a unique perspective on how external economic forces can rapidly make traditional career paths unreliable.

## 2. Sports provides clarity about personal limitations and strengths

Professional athletics forces brutal self-awareness that many traditional careers lack. In rugby, you quickly discover who's stronger, faster, or more skilled than you. This isn't demoralizing when approached correctly. Instead, it becomes a learning opportunity to identify your unique capabilities and focus on what you can control.

This clarity extends beyond physical abilities to mental attributes like persistence and strategic thinking. Ben learned to view teammates who excelled in different areas as teachers rather than threats. This mindset proved invaluable in later career transitions, where he could objectively assess his writing and content creation abilities without getting discouraged by others' success in different areas.

## 3. Career transitions take longer than expected and involve identity mourning

Retiring from professional sports at 30 felt like the right strategic move, but the emotional reality was far more complex. Ben experienced income anxiety, relationship changes, and deep uncertainty about the future. These challenges weren't unique personal failures but statistically common experiences affecting over 50% of retiring athletes.

The most difficult aspect wasn't missing the sport itself but losing the structured environment, constant challenges, and built-in social connections. Professional rugby provided daily rhythm, clear objectives, and automatic teamwork. Transitioning to solitary work on a computer represented a jarring shift from a busy, social environment to isolation and self-direction.

## 4. Self-publishing can be strategically superior to traditional publishing

When Ben approached literary agents about his rugby memoir, one respected sports book agent provided honest feedback. The book was quality work that could be improved, but sports books typically only succeed with big-name authors. The agent recommended self-publishing as the better route, which gave Ben clear direction early in the process.

Self-publishing offered speed and complete creative control, which appealed to someone coming from sports where feedback is immediate. Ben loved being able to pick himself rather than waiting to be chosen by publishers. The book's eventual success, reaching number one in Amazon's rugby category during lockdown, validated this approach and gave him complete ownership of the project.

## 5. Simple content strategies can build substantial audiences

Ben's TikTok approach was deliberately straightforward: read passages from books he genuinely enjoyed while holding them on camera. He committed to just two weeks of daily posts to test the concept. The first video featuring Sally Rooney's "Normal People" performed well, and momentum built naturally from there.

The key was authenticity rather than trying to copy other creators' styles. Ben shared literary fiction and thoughtful non-fiction instead of typical sports content. This differentiated approach attracted engaged followers who appreciated genuine book recommendations. By avoiding the temptation to chase trends or copy popular formats, he built a unique brand that reflected his actual interests.

## 6. Building multiple revenue streams requires patient experimentation

Success came from trying various income sources without immediately optimizing any single one. Ben worked minimum wage at a bike shop, did freelance writing on Upwork, and took on project management roles. Each experience taught valuable skills while providing modest income during the transition period.

The TikTok success eventually led to diverse opportunities: brand partnerships with companies like Amazon and BBC, a retainer relationship with TikTok itself for their official book club, and consulting work with organizations like the German Fashion Council. Rather than rushing to monetize his growing audience, Ben prioritized maintaining quality brand associations and exploring interesting projects that aligned with his interests.

## 7. Online communities can replace traditional networking effectively

Ben actively challenged his assumptions about career development, including his distaste for traditional networking events. He forced himself to attend random meetups and industry talks around Bath and Bristol. However, the most valuable connections came through online communities, particularly Slack groups and virtual webinars that were uncommon before the pandemic.

These digital spaces felt more natural and authentic than in-person networking events. The conversations focused on ideas and mutual support rather than transactional relationship building. Meeting Paul Millerd through an online community in 2019 exemplified how these connections could develop into lasting professional relationships and opportunities.

## 8. Consistency and persistence matter more than perfection

Ben's approach to both writing and content creation emphasized showing up regularly rather than achieving perfection. He posted on TikTok daily when possible and maintained a weekly newsletter despite not having a comprehensive marketing strategy. This consistent presence allowed his audience to grow organically and created opportunities for collaboration.

The mindset shift from waiting to be chosen to choosing himself proved crucial. In sports, selection always depended on coaches and team management. In content creation and writing, he could control the decision to publish and share work. This autonomy, combined with regular output, generated momentum that wouldn't have existed with sporadic, perfection-focused efforts.

## 9. Authentic sharing creates unexpected professional opportunities

Ben's honest LinkedIn article about leaving rugby resonated with readers and led to his first blogging opportunities. The vulnerable admission that "your team will move on without you, you need to move on without them" connected with people facing similar transitions. This authentic voice became his signature across different platforms.

The willingness to share struggles and uncertainties, rather than just successes, attracted people dealing with similar challenges. His books about sports retirement and career transition found audiences because they addressed real problems with honesty. This authenticity also made him attractive to brands and organizations looking for genuine rather than manufactured endorsements.

## 10. Long-term thinking enables sustainable creative careers

Ben's strategy focuses on staying in the game rather than optimizing for any single year's income. Like traders who avoid losing everything at once, he prioritizes not running out of money while building sustainable creative work. This patient approach allows him to turn down projects that don't align with his values or long-term goals.

The combination of TikTok content creation and book writing provides both immediate income and deeper creative satisfaction. TikTok offers daily engagement and various revenue streams, while books allow for concentrated, solo work that he finds fulfilling. This portfolio approach creates resilience and prevents over-dependence on any single income source while maintaining creative integrity.
