Here are the top 10 key takeaways from brain surgeon Dr. Rahul Jandial's conversation with Dr. Rangan Chatterjee about optimizing brain health and cognitive function in our daily lives.

## 1. Intermittent fasting benefits brain function

Intermittent fasting can have significant positive effects on brain function. Dr. Jandial explains that going 16 hours without eating a couple of times a week allows your liver to run out of glucose reserves. Your body then burns fat into ketones, which the brain uses as an alternative fuel source.

This practice isn't about extended fasting for days but rather creating a simple routine like having dinner at 8 PM and not eating again until noon the next day. The neuroscientific literature supports that this kind of intermittent fasting improves attention and focus. The brain is described as a "hybrid vehicle" that can effectively run on both glucose and ketones, making this approach beneficial for cognitive performance.

## 2. Mediterranean diet protects brain health

The Mediterranean diet shows strong evidence for supporting brain health and potentially reducing dementia risk. Dr. Jandial points out that while we don't yet have a pill for Alzheimer's, population studies following thousands of people over extended periods show that those following Mediterranean eating patterns experienced less dementia.

This diet emphasizes plants, nuts, occasional fatty fish (which provides essential omega-3s that maintain neural connections), and limits red meat and fried foods. The fatty components of fish are particularly important as they contain omega-3s, which form the protective wrapping around neural connections that helps electrical signals fire faster. Even for those following vegan diets, the benefits of plant-based eating can outweigh the potential downsides, though B vitamin and omega-3 supplementation may be helpful.

## 3. Deep breathing regulates brain activity

Deliberate deep breathing has been scientifically proven to change electrical activity in the brain. Dr. Jandial describes research where patients with electrodes placed directly on their brain surface showed measurable changes in brain electrical patterns after practicing deep breathing exercises.

This connection works through the vagus nerve, which links the brain to the lungs and heart. Taking just a few minutes several times daily for deep breathing exercises can help manage anxiety and promote alpha brain waves associated with calm focus. The technique is accessible to everyone, requiring no special equipment or cost, and can be particularly effective before stressful situations. Simple patterns like breathing in for a count of four, holding briefly, and releasing slowly can significantly impact your mental state, even after just one breath.

## 4. Exercise bathes the brain in growth factors

Physical activity is essential for brain health because it improves blood flow and triggers the release of beneficial brain chemicals. Dr. Jandial, who studies these mechanisms professionally, explains that exercise keeps "the plumbing open" to the brain, preventing the blood flow restrictions that cause strokes and injuries.

When we exercise, the brain releases brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which functions like "miracle growth" for neural connections. This doesn't require intense athletic performance; simply getting vertical, walking more, or taking the stairs can make a difference. The surgeon emphasizes that "what's good for the heart is good for the brain," highlighting that cardiovascular health directly impacts cognitive function. Even simple changes like standing more often can be a first step toward better brain health.

## 5. Learning new skills creates neural pathways

Regularly challenging your brain with new learning experiences strengthens neural connections and can help prevent cognitive decline. Whether it's learning a language, playing music, or using your non-dominant hand, these activities force your brain to create new pathways and access different regions.

Dr. Jandial emphasizes that the process of learning is more important than mastery. When you try to learn something new, your brain must "pull from different pathways" and "get to different corners of the mind," which is an energy-consuming activity that engages various regions of the brain. This kind of mental exercise is particularly effective at staving off dementia. The neurosurgeon shared his own experience of practicing surgery with his non-dominant hand to develop bilateral skills, noting that this engages brain regions that might otherwise begin to atrophy.

## 6. Sleep quality affects brain function

Uninterrupted sleep appears to be more beneficial for brain health than longer but frequently disrupted sleep. Dr. Jandial suggests that five hours of continuous sleep might provide more benefit than eight hours of sleep interrupted by phone notifications or other disturbances.

Our bodies evolved with natural circadian rhythms tied to the rising and setting of the sun. These rhythms don't just affect sleep patterns but influence DNA expression in tissues throughout the body, including the liver, muscles, and intestines. The disruption of these natural cycles through shift work, excessive screen time, or other modern lifestyle factors can have significant negative impacts on overall health. This understanding has been recognized at the highest scientific levels, with a Nobel Prize awarded for research on circadian biology.

## 7. Flow states optimize brain performance

Flow states represent an optimal brain state where performance becomes effortless and efficient. Dr. Jandial explains that these states aren't simply reflexive actions from extensive practice but rather represent a specific neural configuration. When in flow, the brain actually becomes less active and more efficient in its pathways.

Flow occurs when the "CEO" of the brain (the prefrontal cortex) steps back and allows well-trained subcortical structures to perform without interference. Brain scans of people in flow states show characteristic alpha wave patterns, similar to those observed in elite athletes just before peak performance or Buddhist monks during meditation. Anxiety and stress can disrupt this state by causing subcortical structures to "freak out" and call for frontal lobe intervention, which interferes with performance. Achieving this state requires both mastery through practice and the ability to quiet anxious thoughts.

## 8. Social media's impact remains uncertain

The long-term effects of constant social media use and smartphone distraction on brain development remain largely unknown. Dr. Jandial acknowledges that we lack sufficient longitudinal data to draw definitive conclusions about how these technologies are changing brain structure and function, particularly in developing brains.

While recognizing that these devices provide many benefits, the neurosurgeon expresses concern about the reduction in unstructured thinking time, especially for children and teenagers. He suggests implementing boundaries like keeping devices away for the hour before bedtime to allow the brain to "entertain itself" and enter a state of natural daydreaming. This ability to drift into random thoughts appears particularly important during the pre-sleep period. Dr. Jandial recommends a "digital diet" that includes a mix of quality content and entertainment while establishing reasonable limits.

## 9. Brain plasticity allows remarkable adaptation

The brain demonstrates remarkable adaptability, even following injuries or in response to new challenges. Dr. Jandial has observed this clinically in patients recovering from strokes or brain tumor removals. When certain parts of the brain are compromised, other regions can take over functions with remarkable efficiency.

This plasticity is particularly evident when patients return to the clinic weeks or months after an injury, showing significant improvement in skills that were initially impaired. The same neurological mechanisms that allow recovery from brain injuries can be harnessed by healthy individuals through practices like using their non-dominant hand or learning new skills. These activities recruit brain cells that might otherwise remain underutilized, creating a more balanced and resilient neural network.

## 10. Happiness directly impacts brain structure

Mental and emotional states have measurable physical effects on brain structure. Dr. Jandial states that people experiencing depression or other mental health issues can develop actual changes in their brain structure - essentially becoming "brain injured from the way they are thinking."

Finding sources of happiness and well-being therefore becomes not just a psychological pursuit but a neurological necessity. The pursuit of meaningful relationships, engaging hobbies, and activities that generate positive emotions directly contributes to brain health. Although happiness can be elusive, making conscious choices to engage in fulfilling activities may be one of the most powerful ways to protect and enhance brain function. This connection between emotional well-being and neurological health underscores the importance of addressing mental health as part of overall brain care.
