Here are the top 10 key takeaways from Dr. Rangan Chatterjee's conversation with Dr. Victoria Sampson about why your oral health is crucial for your overall wellbeing, longevity, and quality of life.

## 1. The mouth is the gateway to the rest of the body

Oral health and overall health are deeply interconnected, yet traditionally they've been treated as separate entities. For decades, dentistry and medicine have been divided, with doctors and dentists attending different universities and focusing on different parts of the body.

This separation has created a blind spot in healthcare. Many systemic conditions have strong connections to oral health, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, infertility, Alzheimer's, arthritis, and even certain cancers. The mouth should be viewed as an integral part of the body's overall health system, not as a separate entity.

## 2. Bleeding gums are a warning sign

Bleeding gums should be treated as a serious warning sign, not dismissed as normal. If any other part of your body bled regularly - like your eye or foot - you would likely seek medical attention immediately, yet many people ignore bleeding gums.

Over 80% of people have experienced bleeding gums at some point, making it extremely common. This bleeding indicates inflammation and potential gum disease, which can progress from mild inflammation to serious periodontal disease that leads to bone loss and eventually tooth loss if left untreated. Bleeding gums are an early warning signal that shouldn't be ignored.

## 3. Gum disease affects 3.5 billion people worldwide

Periodontal disease or gum disease is the sixth most prevalent inflammatory condition globally, affecting over 3.5 billion people, with 10% of the global population having severe periodontal disease. According to the World Health Organization, gum disease is entirely preventable.

Many people aren't brushing properly or frequently enough. Poor oral hygiene habits are often passed down from parents to children, creating generational patterns of inadequate dental care. Many people think they know how to brush their teeth correctly but are actually not doing it effectively or for the recommended two minutes twice daily.

## 4. Snacking is harmful for dental health

Frequent snacking is particularly damaging for oral health. Every time you eat, especially sugary foods, your mouth becomes more acidic. This acidity can demineralize teeth and lead to decay if your saliva doesn't have enough time to neutralize and return to a normal pH level.

For those who enjoy sweets, it's better to consume them all at once rather than spread throughout the day. Having a bag of candy in one sitting is less harmful to your teeth than eating one piece every few minutes. After consuming sweets, rinsing with water helps minimize damage, and avoiding sipping sugary or acidic drinks slowly throughout the day is recommended.

## 5. The oral microbiome impacts overall health

The oral microbiome is the second largest and most diverse microbiome after the gut, containing over 700 different species of bacteria making up approximately two billion bacteria. These bacteria can affect the rest of the body when swallowed, inhaled, or by entering the bloodstream through the gums.

An imbalanced oral microbiome can contribute to systemic inflammation. For example, specific oral bacteria have been found in the cerebral spinal fluid of 97% of Alzheimer's patients. Another oral bacterium, Fusobacterium nucleatum, has been identified in over 50% of colorectal cancer cases. These connections highlight how oral bacteria can impact distant organs and systems.

## 6. Dental health affects fertility and pregnancy

Poor oral health can impact both male and female fertility. Women with gum disease may take approximately two months longer to conceive compared to those with healthy gums. During pregnancy, women commonly develop pregnancy gingivitis, and those with gum disease have significantly higher chances of pre-term birth and low birth weight babies.

For men, the impact is equally significant. Men with gum disease are 2.85 times more likely to experience erectile dysfunction due to how oral bacteria affect blood vessel dilation. In a study of subfertile men, over 90% had some form of oral disease. When these conditions were treated, there was a 70% improved pregnancy outcome compared to untreated controls, along with improvements in sperm quality and motility.

## 7. Professional dental cleanings reduce inflammation

Regular professional dental cleanings do more than just remove stains and freshen breath. They significantly reduce inflammatory markers throughout the body, which can have wide-ranging health benefits including improved blood glucose control in diabetic patients.

Studies have shown that just one professional hygiene appointment can reduce inflammatory markers and lower HbA1c levels (a measure of blood glucose) by 0.4% in diabetic patients. This reduction is equivalent to the effect of adding a second medication for diabetes management. Regular dental hygiene appointments, ideally every six months, are an important investment in overall health, not just dental aesthetics.

## 8. Proper teeth brushing technique matters

Many people don't brush their teeth correctly. The proper technique includes brushing for two minutes twice daily and spitting out toothpaste without rinsing with water afterward. Rinsing washes away the beneficial ingredients in toothpaste that continue working after brushing.

Dr. Sampson compares rinsing after brushing to applying sunscreen and then immediately showering - it removes the protective elements before they can work effectively. It's also advisable to avoid toothpastes containing sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), a foaming agent that can disrupt the oral microbiome and irritate soft tissues in the mouth, potentially causing ulcers.

## 9. Nasal breathing improves oral health

Breathing through the nose rather than the mouth during sleep is important for oral health. Mouth breathing introduces bacteria into the oral cavity and causes the mouth to dry out completely, creating an environment conducive to bacterial overgrowth.

Saliva plays a crucial role in maintaining oral health, and keeping the mouth hydrated is essential. Some people use mouth tape at night to encourage nasal breathing. Studies have shown significant improvements in gum health, saliva production, and oral microbiome composition after transitioning from mouth breathing to nasal breathing, whether through mouth taping or orthodontic treatment to address jaw alignment issues.

## 10. Mouthwash should be used selectively

Contrary to popular practice, mouthwash isn't necessary for most people and should be used selectively. Many commercial mouthwashes contain alcohol that can disrupt the oral microbiome by killing both harmful and beneficial bacteria indiscriminately.

Mouthwash should be viewed similar to antibiotics - as a targeted intervention for specific conditions rather than for daily use. If prescribed by a dentist for issues like bad breath or gum disease, it should be used at a different time than brushing to avoid neutralizing the effects of toothpaste. For occasional use, alcohol-free varieties are recommended, and generally, mouthwash should be treated more like perfume - used occasionally for freshness rather than as a regular part of oral care.
