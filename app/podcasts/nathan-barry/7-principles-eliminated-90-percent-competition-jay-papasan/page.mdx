Here are the top 10 key takeaways from Jay Papasan's interview on how he co-authored multiple million-copy bestsellers and built authority in competitive industries.

## 1. Interview top performers to create simple models anyone can follow

When you want to achieve something significant that others have accomplished, the most effective approach is interviewing as many successful people as possible in that field. Jay and Gary interviewed 27 of the top 100 real estate agents to understand what made them successful. They went deep, obtaining copies of P&Ls and having CPAs analyze the financial data to identify patterns.

The key insight is that top performers often follow surprisingly simple models that anyone can implement. The challenge isn't complexity—it's consistency. Most people avoid doing the simple things because they're not easy to maintain over time.

This approach works across any industry. Whether you want to climb Mount Everest or run an ultra-marathon, studying what all successful people have in common reveals actionable strategies. The wisdom of the crowd eliminates guesswork and provides proven frameworks.

## 2. Build credibility by becoming your industry's missing solution

Every industry has fundamental problems or knowledge gaps that create opportunities for thoughtful creators. Real estate agents were seen as salespeople rather than business professionals, so Jay and Gary positioned themselves as the solution by teaching agents how to think and operate like true entrepreneurs.

The strategy involves identifying what your industry is missing and positioning yourself as the answer. This could be through an ebook, lead magnet, or comprehensive guide. The key is giving away valuable knowledge rather than hoarding it as proprietary information.

Books carry special credibility that other marketing materials cannot match. People rarely throw away books, and your marketing message continues circulating as books get passed along or donated. This creates lasting impact and establishes you as a thought leader in your space.

## 3. Success is sequential, not simultaneous

The "one thing" philosophy doesn't mean doing only one thing ever—it means focusing on one thing at a time. Gary continued his regular activities like spending time with family, exercising, and playing guitar while writing. However, he built a system that protected his most important work.

During their 100-day book writing sprint, Gary dedicated two to three hours each morning to the project. Everything else in his schedule was arranged around making those morning sessions productive and non-negotiable. This level of focus allowed them to complete a complex project in record time.

Most people try to pursue multiple important goals simultaneously, which leads to mediocre results across all areas. Sequential focus allows you to give your best energy and attention to what matters most, then move to the next priority once the first is complete.

## 4. Time blocking creates space for your most important work

Treating creative work like any other meeting is essential for consistency. When someone requests a meeting during your blocked creative time, you simply say you're already booked. You never explain that you're writing or working on personal projects, because that invites negotiation.

The principle extends to vacation planning. Block vacation time first, before other commitments fill your calendar. Work flows around obstacles like water around rocks. If you don't protect your most important activities, they'll be crowded out by urgent but less significant tasks.

Most people's calendars contain only appointments with others, never with themselves. This creates a pattern where your most important work gets pushed aside for whatever seems urgent in the moment. Scheduled self-meetings change this dynamic entirely.

## 5. Create accountability systems with specific metrics

Jay has worked with five different coaches over 15 years, with one non-negotiable requirement: they must ask about four specific metrics every session. These include how many books he's read, how many writing sessions he's completed, and other habits that drive success.

The accountability isn't just tracking—it's the certainty that someone will ask. Jay tells his coaches they'll be fired if they stop asking about these metrics, even when he's performing well. This prevents the gradual slide that happens when accountability becomes casual.

He tracks these metrics going back to 2009, creating a visual record of his consistency over time. This data helps identify patterns and periods of decline before they become serious problems. The tracking itself becomes a motivational tool.

## 6. Delay decisions to avoid yes-machines mentality

Entrepreneurs are naturally optimistic and tend to say yes to opportunities without proper evaluation. Jay built a simple system using text shortcuts on his phone to redirect social media requests to email, where he can evaluate all opportunities together rather than responding to the first good option.

He applies core values as a filter for major decisions, requiring any significant commitment to score nine out of ten on impact, family, and abundance. This framework prevents emotional decision-making and ensures alignment with long-term priorities.

The practice of delaying decisions by 24 hours isn't disrespectful—most people understand reasonable consideration time. This small pause allows you to evaluate opportunities against your actual capacity and priorities rather than making impulse commitments.

## 7. Build systems that eliminate repetitive work

When people repeatedly asked Jay for book writing advice, he created a comprehensive video class instead of having individual conversations. He tracked responses for three years and found only one in seven people followed up after watching the class.

This approach either answered their questions completely or filtered out those who weren't serious about the commitment. The ones who did follow up came to conversations with shared vocabulary and understanding, making the actual consultation far more productive.

The principle applies broadly: invest time once to create systems that save time repeatedly. Whether it's delegation, documentation, or automated responses, these upfront investments compound over years. Modern tools like screen recording and wikis make this easier than ever.

## 8. Use books to create industry authority and common language

Writing "The Millionaire Real Estate Agent" gave Keller Williams instant credibility in an industry where they were previously unknown. The book became brand-agnostic education that created a common language for real estate professionals to discuss business practices.

Before the book, agents used different terminology and accounting methods, making it impossible to compare performance or share best practices. Standardizing language allowed the industry to identify patterns, like the consistent 10% reinvestment in lead generation among top performers.

Books provide unique staying power compared to other marketing materials. They get passed along, referenced, and keep working long after publication. This creates compound returns on the initial writing investment and establishes lasting thought leadership.

## 9. Weekly deadlines build creative muscles faster than annual projects

Switching from book deadlines measured in years to weekly newsletter deadlines transformed Jay's writing ability. The consistent practice developed creative muscles that made returning to book writing much easier and faster.

Weekly deadlines create urgency while remaining manageable. Unlike the distant pressure of annual goals, weekly commitments require immediate action and regular completion. This builds confidence and competence through repetition.

The newsletter also became a testing ground for book ideas. Jay could explore concepts, get feedback, and refine messaging before committing to larger projects. This reduces the risk of major creative investments while improving the quality of final products.

## 10. Hire from your audience to find true believers

Three of Jay's team members started as community participants before joining the company. These hires understand the mission deeply and require minimal explanation of company culture and values.

Many creators struggle with hiring because they post on generic job boards instead of leveraging their existing audience. Your email list likely contains people who already understand and value your work—ideal candidates for open positions.

This approach works especially well for service-based businesses where cultural fit matters as much as technical skills. Audience members who become employees often become your best advocates and most effective team members because they're already invested in your success.
