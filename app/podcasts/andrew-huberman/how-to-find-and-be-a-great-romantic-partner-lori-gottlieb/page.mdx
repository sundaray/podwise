Here are the top 20 key relationship insights from psychotherapist Lori Gottlieb that can transform how you connect with partners and understand yourself.

## 1. Feelings as a compass

Our feelings serve as valuable guides rather than problems to eliminate. When we experience emotions like sadness, anger, or anxiety, these feelings provide important information about our circumstances and relationships. Many people are taught from childhood to suppress or ignore their emotions, especially when parents inadvertently dismiss children's feelings by saying things like "don't worry" or "you're too sensitive."

This dismissal of emotions creates adults who believe negative feelings should be eliminated rather than understood. Instead, we should view our emotional responses as a personal compass that helps direct us toward what's beneficial and away from what's harmful. Learning to access and interpret our feelings properly enables better decision-making in relationships and life generally.

## 2. Self-regulation versus co-regulation

Self-regulation involves managing your internal emotional experiences without projecting them onto others. This skill allows you to recognize when you're angry, understand the message behind your anger (like a boundary violation), and respond appropriately without harmful behaviors like yelling or self-sabotage.

Co-regulation occurs when one person's calm emotional state helps another person achieve balance. This is visible in parent-child relationships where a calm parent helps a distressed child learn to self-regulate. In adult relationships, having at least one regulated person during conflict is crucial. When both partners become dysregulated, productive communication becomes impossible. In these moments, taking a break before continuing the discussion is often the best approach.

## 3. Reacting versus responding

Reacting means acting again - repeating old behavioral patterns from the past without thoughtful consideration. When we react, we often layer past emotional experiences onto current situations. This is summarized in the phrase "if it's hysterical, it's historical," meaning intense, disproportionate reactions usually stem from historical wounds.

Responding, by contrast, involves creating space between a stimulus and your reaction. This space allows for thoughtful consideration and better choices. As Viktor Frankl noted, "Between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response." Taking even a five-second pause to breathe and assess a situation can transform a reactive pattern into a responsive one, breaking cycles of harmful communication and behavior.

## 4. The challenge of text communication

Face-to-face conversations provide natural space for reflection and response that text messaging eliminates. In person, we see facial expressions, body language, and can gauge reactions in real time. These cues create natural pauses and encourage more thoughtful exchanges.

Text messaging removes these contextual elements and accelerates communication. People send messages quickly without considering their impact, and emotional conversations held via text often escalate into misunderstandings. Important relationship discussions, especially those involving conflicts or vulnerable topics, should happen face-to-face whenever possible. Many relationship problems stem from important conversations conducted through text when they should have happened in person.

## 5. The importance of change in therapy

The insight gained in therapy is valuable only when it leads to behavioral change. Gottlieb describes insight as "the booby prize of therapy" - if you understand why you behave certain ways but continue the same patterns, therapy isn't achieving its purpose. The goal isn't just awareness but transformation of problematic patterns.

Making changes involves recognizing we're all engaged in relationship "dances" with others. When you change your dance steps, the other person must either adapt their steps or leave the dance floor. This principle works in all relationships - romantic, familial, or professional. While we can't directly change others, we can influence them by changing our own behaviors, which forces new dynamics to emerge.

## 6. The stages of change

Change occurs through distinct stages rather than in a single moment of transformation. The process begins with pre-contemplation, where we don't yet recognize the need to change. Next comes contemplation, where we consider making changes but aren't ready to act. This is followed by preparation, taking small steps to prepare for the change.

The action stage involves actively implementing new behaviors, but this isn't the final stage. Maintenance, the critical final phase, involves sustaining changes through inevitable setbacks. Maintenance resembles the childhood game of chutes and ladders - we make progress, slip back, and climb again. Self-compassion combined with accountability is essential during this phase, as harsh self-criticism typically undermines sustained change.

## 7. Self-compassion with accountability

Self-flagellation after mistakes undermines growth and change, while self-compassion enables accountability. When we're overly critical of ourselves after a setback, we create shame that makes it harder to take responsibility. This is counterproductive to making lasting changes in our behaviors and relationships.

A healthier approach combines self-compassion ("It's understandable I made this mistake") with accountability ("Here's what I'll do differently next time"). This balanced perspective resembles how we might respond to a child who performed poorly on a test - we wouldn't call them stupid, but instead help them understand what happened and make a plan for improvement. This same balanced approach works better for our own growth than harsh self-criticism.

## 8. Understanding how we feel around potential partners

The most reliable indicator of relationship compatibility is how we feel in someone's presence. Rather than focusing primarily on shared interests or superficial attraction, we should pay attention to whether we feel calm, safe, and content around a potential partner. This emotional state is more predictive of relationship success than intense chemistry or passion.

Many people mistakenly prioritize excitement and "butterflies," not realizing these sensations often signal anxiety rather than healthy attraction. Gottlieb recommends asking: "Does this person's presence feel additive to my life? Do I feel more myself, more at ease when I'm with them?" This simple evaluation often provides clearer guidance than analyzing compatibility through external factors like shared hobbies or demographic similarities.

## 9. The danger of "if only" thinking

"If only" thinking creates a dangerous mindset where we focus on what's missing rather than appreciating what exists. This perspective redirects attention from the actual relationship ("what is") to an imagined ideal ("what if"). The mental energy invested in fantasizing about potential improvements prevents us from fully engaging with and appreciating our current circumstances.

Gottlieb describes this as choosing between "what if" and "what is." By constantly focusing on "what if," people blind themselves to the value present in their current situation. This mindset creates perpetual dissatisfaction even in generally healthy relationships. Learning to appreciate "what is" doesn't mean settling for less, but rather engaging fully with reality rather than fantasy.

## 10. The attraction to familiar pain

We often unconsciously seek partners who recreate childhood emotional patterns, even painful ones. This occurs because our brains are drawn to what feels familiar, not necessarily what's healthy. We develop "radar" for people who will trigger similar emotional experiences to those from our formative relationships, setting up repetitive patterns.

This tendency manifests when people keep finding themselves in similar painful relationship dynamics despite consciously wanting something different. The unconscious mind says "you look familiar, come closer" to people who will recreate old wounds. This happens because, at an unconscious level, we're trying to "win" or "master" situations where we felt helpless as children. Understanding this pattern is key to breaking free from repeatedly choosing partners who create similar pain to what we experienced earlier in life.

## 11. The fear of uncertainty and freedom

People often remain in uncomfortable but familiar situations rather than risk uncertainty. This resistance to change resembles a prisoner shaking the bars of their cell while ignoring the open space beside them. The fear of the unknown often outweighs the discomfort of known pain.

With freedom comes responsibility for our choices and lives. Many find this responsibility terrifying because it requires operating without the familiar scripts and patterns that have governed their existence. Fear of uncertainty becomes a justification for remaining in painful situations, whether unhealthy relationships, unfulfilling jobs, or restrictive thought patterns. Gottlieb summarizes this as people preferring "the certainty of misery" over "the misery of uncertainty."

## 12. The maximizer versus the satisficer approach

"Maximizers" constantly seek the best possible option, while "satisficers" choose what meets their standards without endless comparison. Dating apps can transform people into maximizers by creating an illusion of endless options. A maximizer might have a great date but return to the apps thinking someone better might be available, never feeling satisfied with their choices.

Research shows maximizers typically experience less satisfaction even when they obtain objectively "better" outcomes, because the emotional and cognitive energy expended in maximizing often outweighs any incremental benefits gained. The paradox is that having too many choices often leads to decision paralysis and decreased happiness. Dating requires recognizing that no perfect partner exists - everyone has limitations and strengths, and learning to appreciate someone's positive qualities rather than constantly searching for upgrades leads to greater relationship satisfaction.

## 13. The illusion of "chemistry"

Initial intense chemistry or "sparks" may signal familiarity with unhealthy patterns rather than genuine compatibility. When people describe feeling immediate, powerful attraction, they're often responding to unconscious triggers that remind them of past relationship dynamics, even dysfunctional ones. This explains why people repeatedly choose partners who treat them poorly despite claiming to want different experiences.

A more reliable approach involves assessing how you feel with someone over multiple interactions rather than prioritizing immediate fireworks. Many successful long-term couples report their early experiences were pleasant but not intensely passionate. Research shows people often retrospectively describe their first dates with long-term partners as more exciting than they reported at the time, suggesting our narratives about chemistry shift based on relationship outcomes.

## 14. The Bank of Goodwill in relationships

Relationship health depends on maintaining a positive balance in what Gottlieb calls "the Bank of Goodwill." Research suggests relationships need approximately five positive interactions (deposits) for every negative one (withdrawal). When this ratio becomes unbalanced, relationships deteriorate as negative interactions deplete emotional reserves.

Many people focus primarily on what's not working in relationships, making frequent withdrawals while neglecting deposits. Small positive acknowledgments, compliments, and expressions of appreciation function as crucial deposits that sustain relationship health. When conflict arises, couples with well-stocked emotional accounts navigate difficulties more successfully than those operating in emotional deficit. This principle applies to all relationships, not just romantic ones.

## 15. Learning your partner's operating instructions

Understanding your partner's unique "operating instructions" is more valuable than generic approaches like love languages. While everyone appreciates gifts, affirmation, and quality time, truly intimate knowledge involves understanding specific triggers, comfort mechanisms, and communication patterns unique to your partner.

This deeper knowledge includes understanding what being late means to your partner, how they prefer to handle stress, or their unique approach to planning. Gottlieb describes this understanding as profoundly loving: "There's something so loving about understanding somebody's operating instructions and honoring them." Rather than expecting partners to come with clear manuals, couples gradually learn each other's specifications through curious, attentive interaction.

## 16. The problem with "idiot compassion"

"Idiot compassion" involves validating someone's perspective without offering honest feedback or challenging unhelpful patterns. While supportive friends often provide this type of validation ("You're right, he's wrong"), it rarely promotes growth or insight. This differs from "wise compassion," which combines support with truthful reflection.

Wise compassion might involve gently questioning a friend's narrative about a situation or noticing patterns in their relationships. This approach resembles therapeutic interactions, where support combines with helpful challenges to perspective. Surrounding yourself exclusively with people who provide idiot compassion limits personal growth, while cultivating relationships that offer wise compassion facilitates deeper self-understanding and behavioral change.

## 17. The value of facing death awareness

Maintaining awareness of mortality can increase intentionality and vitality in daily life. Rather than being morbid, death awareness serves as a powerful motivator for living authentically and prioritizing what truly matters. When people deny death's reality, they often postpone meaningful experiences and remain stuck in unsatisfying circumstances.

Gottlieb describes death awareness as something that should "sit on your shoulder" as a reminder of life's preciousness and finite nature. This perspective encourages moving beyond fear-based decisions and toward choices aligned with core values. Many people's regrets near life's end center not on what they did, but on what they didn't do out of fear or complacency. Regular contemplation of mortality can provide the needed perspective to make braver, more authentic choices in relationships and life generally.

## 18. Numbness as emotional overwhelm

What appears as emotional numbness is actually a state of being overwhelmed by too many feelings. People often describe themselves as "feeling nothing" or "going numb" in difficult situations, but this state represents emotional flooding rather than absence of feeling. The nervous system essentially shuts down when emotions become too intense to process.

This understanding is particularly important in relationships where one partner (often stereotypically male) appears emotionally detached or unresponsive. Rather than lacking feelings, they may be experiencing emotional overload without effective processing tools. Addressing emotional numbness requires identifying the overwhelming feelings beneath the surface rather than assuming an absence of emotion. Helping people develop emotional regulation skills allows them to access and express these submerged feelings productively.

## 19. The therapeutic value of thinking

Taking time to think deliberately about challenges represents an underutilized but powerful practice for emotional well-being. While many wellness approaches focus on physical interventions (exercise, nutrition, cold exposure), simply setting aside five minutes to think through a problem can yield significant insights and behavioral changes.

This practice involves stopping other activities when feeling triggered or activated and asking questions like "What's really happening here?" or "Why am I having such a strong reaction to this?" This contemplative approach often reveals patterns and motivations that weren't immediately apparent. Though it might seem like a luxury given busy schedules, Gottlieb argues "you don't have the time not to do it" given how significantly it can improve decision-making and relationship quality.

## 20. The power of asking "what makes me difficult to be with?"

Creating a list of qualities that make you difficult to partner with offers more relationship insight than listing what you want in others. Most people readily enumerate desired partner qualities without equivalent self-reflection about their own challenging traits. This one-sided focus creates unrealistic expectations and diminished self-awareness.

Gottlieb recommends a balanced approach: for every trait you desire in a partner, identify a trait in yourself that could be challenging for others. This exercise promotes humility and realistic expectations about relationship compromise. It also highlights areas for potential growth while developing appreciation for partners who accept these difficult aspects. The resulting self-awareness helps overcome the "maximizer" tendency to constantly seek better options, creating greater relationship satisfaction through balanced expectations.
